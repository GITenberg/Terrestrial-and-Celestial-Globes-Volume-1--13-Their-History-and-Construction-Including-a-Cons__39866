<h2>Foreword.</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><b>ITHERTO</b> there has not appeared in English a detailed
historical treatise on globes terrestrial and celestial. The
publications are somewhat numerous, it is true, in which a
very general consideration has been given to the uses of
globes, including a reference to their important structural
features, and to the problems geographical and astronomical
in the solution of which they may be counted of service.
There are a few studies, critical and historical, touching
certain selected examples of the early globe maker&#8217;s
handiwork which can be cited. Attention, for example, may
here be directed to Sir Clements Markham&#8217;s valuable
introduction to his excellent English translation of Hues&#8217;
&#8216;Tractatus de Globis,&#8217; a work originally prepared for the
purpose of furnishing a description of the Molyneaux globes,
in which introduction he undertook &#8220;to pass in review the
celestial and terrestrial globes which preceded or were
contemporaneous with the first that were made in England
(1592) so far as a knowledge of them has come down to us,&#8221;
yet the learned author cites but a fraction of the many
globes referred to in the following pages. In Ravenstein&#8217;s
&#8216;Behaim, His Life and His Globe,&#8217; we have perhaps the most
scholarly treatment of its kind in any language, but the
study is limited to the work of one man, the maker of the
oldest extant terrestrial globe, which is dated 1492.</p>

<p>The bibliographical list which is appended gives striking
evidence that there has been a more or less extended
interest in the general subject of the use and the
construction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span> globes in France, in Germany, in England,
and in Italy. The author makes in this place special mention
of his indebtedness to the studies of the distinguished
Italian scholar, Professor Matteo Fiorini, adding that with
some propriety his name might have a place on the
title-page. Had there not been a ready access to his
important works, had the Italian Geographical Society not so
graciously expressed to the author its willingness for the
free use of as much of his published investigations as might
be desired, for which it stood in the relation of sponsor
publisher, a willingness which Fiorini himself had assured
to any who might have access to the printed results of his
studies within this field, the preparation of this work
necessarily would have extended over a considerable period
of time. Special mention must be made of his &#8216;Sfere
Terrestri e Celesti di Autore Italiano oppure fatte o
conservate in Italia,&#8217; and of his &#8216;Sfere cosmografiche e
specialmente le Sfere Terrestri.&#8217; These works have been of
very signal value for the study of the Italian globes and
globe makers. Not an inconsiderable part of his descriptive
details has been appropriated, being given in free
translation or in paraphrase, quotation marks having been
omitted. Special mention may also here be made of Sigmund
G&uuml;nther&#8217;s interesting little volume, which he titles
&#8216;Erd- und Himmelsgloben nach dem italienischen Matteo
Fiorinis frei bearbeitet.&#8217; This has been of special value
for its bibliographical references and for its short
chapters on globe-gore construction.</p>

<p>To attempt the listing, with description, of all globes
known to have been constructed from the earliest times to
the close of the eighteenth century, the latter being a
somewhat arbitrary date, is pretentious. The fact is fully
appreciated that in many instances the description given is
all too brief. Many of the individual terrestrial globe maps
of the period in question, it should be especially noted,
are of the greatest historical and scientific value; but to
have undertaken a more detailed and a more critical study
merely of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span> those which may be called the most important
might well have demanded far more time and special research
than could have been fittingly allowed for a general survey
such as has here been planned; in such a course we should
indeed have been led afield from our purpose.</p>

<p>It had been thought when this study was first undertaken
that perhaps as many as one hundred existing examples might
be located, and that in addition to these not a few
important references might be found to work actually done
but now lost. Instead of the one hundred, more than eight
hundred and fifty have been listed, and from the interesting
experience in collecting material for the work, the
pleasurable hope is entertained that the published record of
this effort will be in some measure the means of bringing to
light not a score but scores of other examples. Indulging
this hope there have been added to each copy of the book a
few blank pages for the insertion of a reference to any not
mentioned in the following printed pages. The author begs in
this connection to add an expression of his grateful
appreciation for any word which may be sent to him
concerning unmentioned examples, to the end that in a
revised edition such examples may be fittingly noted. The
great war checked the search for existing examples, and
prevented the inclusion of many illustrations which had been
promised, but these were promises which could not be
fulfilled.</p>

<p>An attempt has been made, as before noted, to treat the
subject historically, beginning with the earliest references
to the belief in a spherical earth and a spherical firmament
encircling it. It is not easy to fix, with anything like a
satisfactory measure of certainty, the beginning of globe
construction; very naturally it was not until a spherical
theory concerning the heavens and the earth had been
accepted, and for this we are led back quite to Aristotle
and beyond, back indeed to the Pythagoreans if not yet
farther. We find allusions to celestial globes in the days
of Eudoxus and Archimedes, to terrestrial globes in the days
of Crates and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span> Hipparchus. We find that the Greek
geographer Strabo gives us quite a definite word concerning
their value and their construction, and that Ptolemy is so
definite in his references to them as to lead to a belief
that globes were by no means uncommon instruments in his
day, and that they were regarded of much value in the study
of geography and astronomy, particularly of the latter
science. There is, however, but one example known, which has
come down to us from that ancient day, this a celestial
globe, which is noted below and briefly described as the
Farnese globe. It is of marble, and is thought by some to
date from the time of Eudoxus, that is, three hundred years
before the Christian era.</p>

<p>To the Mohammedans belongs chief credit for keeping alive an
interest in astronomical studies during the so-called
Christian middle ages, and we find them interested in globe
construction, that is, in celestial globe construction; so
far as we have knowledge, it seems doubtful that they
undertook the construction of terrestrial globes.</p>

<p>Among the Christian peoples of Europe in this same period
there was not wanting an interest in both geography and
astronomy. We are now learning that those centuries were not
entirely barren of a certain interest in sciences other than
theological. In Justinian&#8217;s day, or near it, one Leontius
Mechanicus busied himself in Constantinople with globe
construction, and we have left to us his brief descriptive
reference to his work. With stress laid, during the many
centuries succeeding, upon matters pertaining to the
religious life, there naturally was less concern than there
had been in the humanistic days of classical antiquity as to
whether the earth is spherical in form or flat like a
circular disc, nor was it thought to matter overmuch as to
the form of the heavens. Yet there was no century, not even
in those ages we happily are learning to call no longer
dark, that geography and astronomy were not studied and
taught, and globes celestial as well as armillary spheres,
if not terrestrial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span> globes, were constructed. The
Venerable Bede, Notker Labeo, Pope Sylvester I, the Emperor
Frederick II, and King Alfonso of Castile, not to name many
others of perhaps lesser significance, displayed an interest
in globes and globe making.</p>

<p>The modern age opens with an interest in the expansion of
Europe overland eastward, with this interest soon to be
followed by greater enthusiasm in transoceanic expansion.
With the rapidly increasing knowledge concerning the
hitherto unknown or but little known regions of the earth
came a desire for better map making, came an interest
intelligently directed in the construction of terrestrial
globes on which the newly discovered parts might be
represented in their relative positions as they are on the
real spherical earth. To this interest Martin Behaim gave
striking expression, producing in the year 1492 his famous
&#8220;Erdapfel&#8221; referred to above as the oldest extant
terrestrial globe. His century closes with every evidence
that the spherical theory, as Aristotle had expressed it
nearly two thousand years before, could alone be accepted by
geographers, and if spherical, the fact could be most
impressively taught by the use of a material representation,
that is, by means of a terrestrial globe.</p>

<p>The sixteenth century opened with a marvelously increased
interest in geography, the result of a climax reached
through the transoceanic discoveries in which Columbus led
the way. If the makers of plane maps became now increasingly
active, so the makers of globes were becoming increasingly
numerous, and at first in the countries of trans-alpine
Europe. Globes of metal with engraved maps, as the Lenox and
the Jagellonicus copper spheres, globes with manuscript maps
covering a sphere of special composition, as were those of
Sch&ouml;ner, globes in the preparation of which engraved
gore maps were employed; as the Waldseem&uuml;ller, the
Boulengier, the Gemma, and the Mercator, make their
appearance in ever increasing numbers, the activity
encouraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</a></span> by those interested in a scientific study of
geography and astronomy, and notably by seamen, in whose
collection of navigator&#8217;s instruments they were long
considered to be of the greatest importance.</p>

<p>How the globe interest in the several countries of Europe
found expression during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and
eighteenth centuries is fully set forth in the following
pages, with something of an attempt at a grouping and a
classification of the results, to the end of making more
clear the trend of that interest, now quickened, now
retarded, by certain temporary or permanent national
impulses.</p>

<p>It is especially interesting to note how a certain
superiority in globe making exhibited itself, now in one
country, now in another, with a lingering favor exhibited in
Italy for the manuscript or the metal globe, while in the
North, globes with copper engraved gore maps found
increasing favor from the first, with a certain climax
reached in the Netherlands in the days of Hondius and Blaeu.</p>

<p>In the appended tabulated list of globes and globe makers,
it will be noted that the makers have been listed
alphabetically, that the kind of globe has been indicated,
whether terrestrial, celestial or armillary sphere, with the
date given, though sometimes only approximately, and with
the diameter of each globe recorded in centimeters, so far
as obtainable with an acceptable degree of accuracy,
fractions thereof being omitted, these same measurements
being repeated in the text reference to each individual
example or edition.</p>

<p>The author had been ambitious to include in his
illustrations a reproduction of each known example or
edition, showing at least the general appearance of each,
but he fully realizes the more or less unsatisfactory
character of a small print, and the unsatisfactory results
of an attempt to photograph the curved surface of a sphere.
Not a few of the many examples would prove to be of the
greatest interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">xxv</a></span> and scientific value could the entire
map surface have been given in reproduction and in size to
be easily legible. It however can be readily understood how
such an undertaking was necessarily considered to be
unpractical. Out of the author&#8217;s collection of about four
hundred globe photographs, a selection has been made of
those which it has been thought would be most suitable for
illustrative purposes.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the preliminary study herewith presented
may lead to a number of independent and thorough
investigations of important individual examples, to the end
of clearly setting forth their great documentary value.</p>

<p>There have been added to the list of illustrations certain
important legends as they appear in the original, likewise a
number of contemporary portraits of the distinguished globe
and map makers of the last three centuries. In most
instances important legends have been cited in the text in
the exact language of the original, to which, with very few
exceptions, a translation is added. The critical student
will occasionally be somewhat astounded at the incorrectness
of the language, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French or German,
in the original. The translations into English, not
infrequently, have been made with difficulty; accordingly it
will be noted in some instances that the translation is
conjectural. No attempt has been made to correct errors; on
the contrary, the greatest care has been exercised to adhere
faithfully to the original as given by the map or globe
maker.</p>

<p>The bibliographical list appended is full, but completeness
is not pretended. Practically all of the works cited have
been consulted, and care has been taken to include those
held to be of the greatest importance. It will at least
serve as a working list for those students who may wish to
make further investigations within the field under
consideration.</p>

<p>An expression of sincerest thanks is here recorded to the
very many librarians, directors of museums, and private
individuals who have so graciously responded to requests
for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</a></span> information concerning the globes belonging to their
several collections. The privilege so readily conceded for
photographing the several examples, and the time and trouble
expended in having this work of reproduction well done, are
nothing less than a striking evidence of the kindliest
fraternal spirit existing among those engaged in scientific
and literary pursuits the world over. To the requests
presented even the antipodes have responded.</p>

<p>In concluding, the author might refer to his interest in
globes as dating from his early boyhood days, when, in that
country school in western Illinois, bearing the name
Liberty, for it had been established in the first years of
the Civil War, he studied his geography and indeed his
astronomy lessons with the aid of a terrestrial globe and an
orrery. Can it be that we have revised our educational
methods so far in this country as practically to have
eliminated the intelligent use of aids so valuable in the
study of the branches which globes concern? They enter in
fact but little into modern methods of instruction. If this
work could be made to encourage their extensive use, and
serve in their rehabilitation as aids of inestimable
interest and value in geographical and astronomical studies,
it will have served the purpose which is most pleasing to
the author.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><b>HE</b> beginnings of the science of astronomy and of the science
of geography are traceable to a remote antiquity. The
earliest records which have come down to us out of the
cradleland of civilization contain evidence that a lively
interest in celestial and terrestrial phenomena was not
wanting even in the day of history&#8217;s dawning. The primitive
cultural folk of the Orient, dwellers in its great plateau
regions, its fertile valleys, and its desert stretches were
wont, as we are told, to watch the stars rise nightly in the
east, sweep across the great vaulted space above, and set in
the west as if controlled in their apparent movement by
living spirits. To them this exhibition was one marvelous
and awe-inspiring. In the somewhat strange grouping of the
stars they early fancied they could see the forms of many of
the objects about them, of many of their gods and heroes,
and we find their successors outlining these forms in
picture in their representations of the heavens on<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span> the material spheres which they
constructed. Crude and simple, however, were their
astronomical theories relative to the shape, the structure,
and the magnitude of the great universe in which they found
themselves placed.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Then too, as stated, there was something of interest to the
people of that early day in the simple problems of
geography; problems suggested by the physical features of
their immediate environment; problems arising as they
journeyed for trade or traffic, or the love of adventure, to
regions now near, now remote. Very ancient records tell us
of the attempts they made, primitive indeed most of them
were, to sketch in general outline small areas of the
earth&#8217;s surface, usually at first the homeland of the map
maker, but to which they added as their knowledge expanded.
The early Egyptians, for example, as we long have known,
made use of rough outline drawings (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f1">1</a>)<a name=
"FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> to represent certain<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span> features of special sections of their
country, and recently discovered tablets in the lower
Mesopotamian valley (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f2">2</a>) interestingly show us how
far advanced in the matter of map making the inhabitants of
that land were two thousand years before the Christian
era.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> We are likewise assured, through references in the
literature of classical antiquity, that maps were made by
the early Greeks and Romans, and perhaps in great numbers as
their civilization advanced, though none of their
productions have survived to our day. To the Greeks indeed
belongs the credit of first reducing geography and map
making to a real science.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> No recent discovery by
archaeologist or by historian, interesting as many of their
discoveries have been, seems to warrant an alteration of
this statement, long accepted as fact.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;2. Tablet Representing Babylonian World-Plan.</p></div>

<p>The credit of being the first scientific cartographer has
been generally assigned to the Greek Anaximander of Miletus
(610-547 B.&nbsp;C.).<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> While there is not a detailed<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span> description extant of the maps
he is reputed to have made, we know that he accepted the
so-called Homeric idea, that the earth has the form of a
circular disc,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and is surrounded by the Ocean Stream, an
idea generally approved by the Ionic School of
Philosophers.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> It is not improbable that we have an allusion
to the work of Anaximander in the History of Herodotus
(484-400? B.&nbsp;C.), wherein we are told that Aristagoras, the
tyrant of Miletus, when on a mission to Cleomenes, the King
of Sparta, carried with him &#8220;a copper plate on which was
engraved the whole circuit of the earth, and likewise all
the Seas and Rivers.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> In another passage, Herodotus takes
occasion to criticise maps of this circular character. &#8220;I
laugh,&#8221; he says, &#8220;when I see that, though many before this
have drawn maps of the Earth, yet no one has set the matter
forth in an intelligent way; seeing that they draw the Ocean
flowing round the Earth, which is circular as if drawn with
compasses, and they make Asia equal in size to Europe. In a
few words I shall declare the size of each division and of
what nature it is as regards outline.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_9"
id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> It is, however, interesting to observe
that the father of historical geography and of history
nowhere records his idea of a properly constructed map, and
further that the circular form, which he condemned, is one
which found wide acceptance even to the close of the middle
ages.</p>

<p>We are not definitely informed as to just the course of
improvement or advancement in early scientific map making
among the Greeks, yet not a few names are known to us of
those who made it a matter of special endeavor, as they
specifically stated, to improve the work of their
predecessors. We, for example, are told that Hecataeus
(550-480 B.&nbsp;C.),<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> likewise a native of Miletus, improved
the maps of Anaximander, and that scientists of his day were
astonished at his results; that Dicaearchus of Massina
(350-290 B.&nbsp;C.)<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> was the first to employ a central line of
orientation on a map, one passing through the Mediterranean
east and west, and that he represented on his map all the
lands known since <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>the expedition of Alexander the Great
into the Far East; and further, that Eratosthenes, the
librarian of Alexandria (276-196 B.&nbsp;C.),<a
name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> was the first to
attempt a representation of the curved surface of the earth
on a plane in accord with geometrical rules. The scientific
cartographical ideas of Eratosthenes were further developed
by Hipparchus (180-125 B.&nbsp;C.),<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> who is generally referred
to as the greatest astronomer of antiquity, and by Marinus
of Tyre (fl. ca. 100 A.&nbsp; D.),<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> who introduced the idea of
inscribing lines of latitude and longitude on a map,
crossing the same at right angles, which lines could be made
to serve the useful purpose of orientation and be of
assistance in giving proper location to all known places on
the earth&#8217;s surface.</p>

<p>Map making in that early period reached its climax in the
work of Claudius Ptolemy of Alexandria (ca. 87-150 A.&nbsp;D.).<a
name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> His ideas, however,
seem not to have found general favor with his
contemporaries, nor with the geographers of the middle ages.
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f3">3.</a>) It was not until the so-called period of
great geographical discoveries and explorations in the
fifteenth century that he became a real teacher within his
chosen field.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f3" id="f3"></a>
<img src="images/f3.jpg" width="500" height="351" alt=
"Ptolemy World Map." title="" />

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;3. Ptolemy World Map.</p></div>

<p>Map making and the science of geography were continuously
progressive among the Greeks. Imperial Rome witnessed little
progress in either field. Among those who wrote in the Latin
language, Pomponius Mela (fl. ca. 43 A.&nbsp;D.)<a name=

<p>The idea of a globular earth was at first accepted by the
geographers of antiquity with some hesitancy. That Thales
(640-548 B.&nbsp;C.),<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> one of the earliest astronomers and
cosmographers, openly supported this theory, as is
sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span> asserted, is hardly probable. It is rather to
be assumed that according to his idea the earth has the form
of a cylinder, and that it moves within a hollow sphere, an
idea upheld by Anaximander, his disciple and successor, to
whom reference has been made above. It was the Pythagorean
philosophers who appear to have first transferred to the
earth that which had already been accepted as a theory
relative to the heavens, including the imaginary circles and
the circular or spherical form, apparently arguing that the
earth is a sphere because that is the most perfect form,
that it is located in the center of the universe because
that is the place of honor, and that it is at rest because
rest is more dignified than motion.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> It however was
Aristotle who undertook, in the manner of a philosopher, an
elaborate defense of the Pythagorean doctrine of a globular
earth, supporting his arguments, first, through a reference
to such positive proof as may be found in gravitation or
&#8220;the tendency of all particles of matter to form themselves
about the middle and thus make a sphere,&#8221; and secondly,
through a reference to the appearance of the earth&#8217;s shadow
cast during an eclipse of the moon.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21"
class="fnanchor">21</a> A third proof, so familiar to us today,
that distant objects as we approach them gradually reveal
themselves above the horizon, seems not to have occurred to
Aristotle, but was first employed by Strabo. &#8220;It is
evident,&#8221; says the latter, &#8220;that, when persons on shipboard
are unable to see at a distance lights which are on a level
with the eye, the cause of this is the curvature of the sea;
for if those lights are raised to a higher level, they
become visible, even though the distance is increased; and
in like manner, if the beholder attains a greater elevation
he sees what was previously hidden.... Again, when men are
approaching the land from the sea, the parts nearest the
shore-line come more and more into view, and objects which
at first appeared low attain a greater elevation.&#8221;<a name=

<p>After the attempt had been made to determine the
circumference of the earth, as was done by Eratosthenes with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>more or less satisfactory results, the thought, very
naturally, was suggested of making an artificial
representation of the entire earth, so far as then
understood, that is, of making a terrestrial globe. There is
no intimation, however, in any early allusion to
Eratosthenes that he was a globe maker, or that he knew
anything about globe construction. We know that he thought
of the earth as a sphere placed in the center of the
universe, around which the celestial sphere revolves every
twenty-four hours.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Strabo, at a much later date, in
referring to the geographical ideas of Eratosthenes,
censured him for his unnecessarily elaborate proofs of the
earth&#8217;s spherical character, apparently thinking the fact
one too well known to require demonstration.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;5. Globe according to Crates.</p></div>

<p>It appears to have been the grammarian Crates of Mallos, a
contemporary of Hipparchus, and a member of the Stoic School
of Philosophers, who made the first attempt to construct<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span> a terrestrial globe (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f5">5</a>),
and that he exhibited the same in Pergamum, not far from the
year 150 B.&nbsp;C.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> It seems to have been Crates&#8217; idea that the
earth&#8217;s surface, when represented on a sphere, should appear
as divided into four island-like habitable regions. On the
one hemisphere, which is formed by a meridional plane
cutting the sphere, lies our own oecumene or habitable
world, and that of the Antoecians in corresponding longitude
and in opposite latitude; on the other hemisphere lies the
oecumene of the Perioecians in our latitude and in opposite
longitude, and that of the Antipodes in latitude and
longitude opposite to us.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> Through the formulation and
expression of such a theory the idea of the existence of an
antipodal people was put forth as a speculative problem, an
idea frequently discussed in the middle ages, and settled
only by the actual discovery of antipodal regions and
antipodal peoples in the day of great transoceanic
discoveries.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> That Strabo, at a later date, had this
Pergamenian example in mind when stating certain rules to be
observed in the construction of globes seems probable, since
he makes mention of Crates&#8217; globe. Strabo alone among
ancient writers, so far as we at present know, treats of
terrestrial globes, practically such as we find in use at
the present day. He thought that a globe to be serviceable
should be of large size, and his reasoning can readily be
understood, for what at that time was really known of the
earth&#8217;s surface was small indeed in comparison with what was
unknown. Should one not make use of a sphere of large
dimensions, the habitable regions (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f6">6</a>), in
comparison with the earth&#8217;s entire surface, would occupy but
small space. What Strabo states in his geography is
interesting and may here well be cited. &#8220;Whoever would
represent the real earth,&#8221; he says, &#8220;as near as possible by
artificial means, should make a sphere like that of Crates,
and upon this draw the quadrilateral within which his chart
of geography is to be placed. For this purpose however a
large globe is necessary since the section mentioned,
though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span> but a very small portion of the entire sphere, must
be capable of containing properly all the regions of the
habitable earth and of presenting an accurate view of them
to those who wish to consult it. Any one who is able will
certainly do well to obtain such a globe. But it should have
a diameter of not less than ten feet; those who can not
obtain a globe of this size, or one nearly as large, had
better draw their charts on a plane surface of not less than
seven feet. Draw straight lines for the parallels, and
others at right angles to these. We can easily imagine how
the eye can transfer the figure and extent (of these lines)
from a plane surface to one that is spherical. The meridians
of each country on the globe have a tendency to unite in a
single point at the poles; nevertheless on the surface of a
plane map there would be no advantage if the right lines
alone which should represent the meridians were drawn
slightly to converge.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;6. Globe according to Strabo.</p></div>

<p>It is not at all improbable that Strabo and Ptolemy
made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span> considerable advance in the practical construction
of terrestrial globes, for it seems reasonable to conclude
that they were in possession of such objects when writing,
as they did, concerning them.</p>

<p>Ptolemy, we may note, expressly allowed that the size of a
globe should be that which one might desire, and that it was
not necessary it should be of large size. It was this great
Alexandrian cosmographer who first demonstrated the
scientific value of drawing on the surface of a globe or map
the network of parallels and meridians, and of establishing
by means of the two geographical co&ouml;rdinates the true
geographical position of every known place. To the end of
making globes more serviceable he suggested the use of a
meridian circle, such as is today employed in globe
construction, passing through both poles, within which
circle the globe might be made to move freely on its axis.
He, however, in this connection, did not give technical
directions for the construction of terrestrial globes, but
he says enough to assure us that the art of globe
construction was measurably well understood in his day, and
that the Greeks and the Romans considered them very useful
instruments in the study of the heavens and the earth.<a
name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28"
class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>The allusions of the naturalist Pliny (23-79 A. D.) to the
spherical shape of the earth give us no particular
intimation that he knew of the existence of terrestrial
globes, but they are interesting as indicating a belief of
his time in its spherical form, a belief, judging from the
nature of the argument, apparently drawn from Aristotle.
Referring to the shape of the earth, he observes that
&#8220;everyone agrees it has the most perfect figure. We always
speak of the ball of the earth, and we admit it to be a
globe bounded by the poles. It has not indeed the form of an
absolute sphere, from the number of lofty mountains and flat
plains; but if the termination of the lines be bound by a
curve, this would compose a perfect sphere. And this we
learn from arguments drawn from the nature of things,
although not from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span> same considerations which we have
made use of with respect to the heavens. For in the heavens
the hollow convexity everywhere bends on itself and leans
upon the earth as a center, whereas the earth rises up solid
and dense like something that swells up and is protruded
outward. The heavens bend toward the center, while the earth
goes out from the center, the continual rolling of the
heavens about it forcing its immense mass into the form of a
sphere.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

possessed general culture. Cleomedes, Ampelius, Nonnus, and

<p>It was thought that Africa did not extend to the equator, or
at least was not habitable to the equator. Below the equator
there was thought to be water but beyond the uninhabitable
and impassable torrid zone a habitable region. The map of
Lambertus well represents this early theory. Pomponius Mela
called the inhabitants of this southern region
&#8220;Antichthoni,&#8221; their country being unknown to us because of
the torrid zone intervening. Pliny, and after him Solinus,
says that for a long time the island of Taprobana (Ceylon)

globes, solid balls as well as armillary spheres, were
constructed in those early centuries, for both practical and
ornamental purposes. There exists, however, considerable
uncertainty as to the exact character of the earliest of
these globes.</p>

<p>The information we have concerning the Ionic School of
Philosophers, of which school Thales is reputed to have been
the founder, does not give us any satisfactory evidence that
attempts were made by any of their number at a material
representation of their astronomical or geographical
theories. They were content, in the main, with mere
philosophical or cosmical speculations. The statement,
therefore, that Thales himself constructed a celestial
globe, on which to represent his notion of the crystal
sphere, is not well authenticated.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30"
class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>While not assured to us by any positive statement, there
appears to be good reason for believing the astronomer
Eudoxus of Cnidos (409-356 B.&nbsp;C.) made use of a celestial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>globe on which to represent certain astronomical theories
which he entertained.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> He traveled in Egypt in his later
life, where he carried on his studies, and where he seems to
have learned the construction of star catalogues. On his
return to his own country he is reported to have undertaken
the representation of the several constellations known to
him, on a celestial sphere. The astronomical poem of Aratus
(fl. 270 B.&nbsp;C.),<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> so frequently cited and copied in
following centuries, is considered to be a description of
the constellations according to Eudoxus.</p>

<p>In the Royal Museum of Naples there may be found a large
marble celestial globe, 65 cm. in diameter (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f7">7</a>),
which the mythical Atlas bears on his shoulders, the statue
itself being 1.86 m. in height, resting on one knee.<a
name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33"
class="fnanchor">33</a> This very interesting and artistic
object was transferred to Naples museum from the Farnese
Palace in Rome, hence is generally referred to as the
Atlante Farnesiano. Forty-two constellations are represented
on its surface (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f8">8</a>), and the five wanting,
including Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, probably owe their
absence to the obliteration which time has brought about.
From the position of the several constellations, relative to
the intersecting points of the ecliptic with the equator, it
is thought that it must have been constructed at least three
hundred years before the Christian era. It seems therefore
to date from about the time of Eudoxus, being then the
oldest extant globe.</p>

<p>We learn from Cicero and from other early writers that
Archimedes (ca. 287-212 B.&nbsp;C.), the celebrated geometrician
of Syracuse, constructed a globe or contrivance for the
purpose of demonstrating the movements of the heavenly
bodies. Cicero&#8217;s statements imply that the work of
Archimedes was well known in his day, yet he thought it
merited a special word of commendation from himself. &#8220;I
shall propose nothing new to you,&#8221; he says, &#8220;nor that which
I have invented or discovered; but I remember C. Sulpicius
Gallus, a very learned man, as you know, when this
appearance <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>(in the heavens) was spoken of, and he was, by
chance, at the house of Marcellus, who had been consul with
him, he described a globe among the spoils of that opulent
and magnificent city of Syracuse, when captured, as the only
thing among all the spoils which he ordered to be carried to
his own house; about which globe I have often heard, on
account of the fame of Archimedes, although the work itself
was not very remarkable, for there was another far more
beautiful and more honored by the common people, made by the
same Archimedes, and placed in the Temple of Virtue by the
same Marcellus. But afterward when Gallus began to explain
scientifically the object of the machine, I thought there
was more ingenuity in that Sicilian than human nature was
capable of. For Gallus informed me that there was another
ancient invention of a solid and elaborately formed globe
which was made by Thales, the Milesian, to revolve. And
afterward the same was, by Eudoxus of Cnidos, the disciple
of Plato, adorned with the fixed stars of heaven, and with
every ornament and embellishment, as described by Eudoxus,
and was many years afterward celebrated by Aratus, not
exactly in the scientific language of astronomy, but with
the graces of poetry. This species of globe indeed, in which
the sun and moon were made to revolve, and five of those
stars which have been called travelers, and as it were
wanderers, could not possibly be exhibited on that solid
sphere. And more especially was that invention of Archimedes
to be admired, for he had so contrived that one revolution
of the machine served somehow to produce unequal and varied
movements through their different paths. For when Gallus set
the globe in motion, the moon succeeded the sun by as many
turns of the brass wheel of the machine as days in the
heavens, so that the globe represented in the heavens the
same eclipse of the sun, when the moon arrived at a certain
place or point, as the shadow of the earth did when the sun
shone from the opposite region.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34"
class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>Lactantius&#8217; allusion to Archimedes, at a later date, is
perhaps derived from Cicero, but it is none the less
interesting as indicating a belief that such a globe had
existed. In his characteristic vein he refers to the
mechanical device, finding therein a support for his
theological arguments. &#8220;Was Archimedes of Sicily able to
contrive a likeness and representation of the universe in
hollow brass,&#8221; he inquires, &#8220;in which he so arranged the sun
and moon, that they effected, as it were every day, motions
unequal and resembling the revolutions of the heavens, and
that sphere, while it revolved, exhibited not only the
approaches and with drawings of the sun or the increase and
waning of the moon, but also the unequal course of the
stars, whether fixed or wandering? Was it then impossible
for God to plan and create the original, when the skill of
man was able to represent them by imitation? Would the
stoic, therefore, if he should have seen the figures of the
stars painted and fashioned in that brass, say that they
moved by their own design, and not by the genius of the
artificer?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> G&uuml;nther notes that at the beginning of
the seventh book of the collection of Pappus, geometrician
of Alexandria, may be found a reference to those skilled in
mechanical devices in which it is stated that &#8220;Mechanicians
are those who understand how to construct celestial globes
and to represent the heavens and the course of the stars
moving in circles by means of like circular movements of
water.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> It has been thought that in this passage we have a
reference to a globe such as was probably constructed by
Archimedes, although the reference is not to any particular
example. It seems not improbable that the globe of
Archimedes was made to revolve by an hydraulic contrivance,
and that it resembled a planetarium or orrery.<a name=
"FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> That the science of
hydrostatics had been developed by Archimedes&#8217; time to a
high degree is very certain.</p>

<p>Instruments for measuring angles and distances were very
early employed in the field of astronomy as well as in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span> field of geography. Of these instruments the Egyptian
<i>gnomon</i> appears to have been the oldest.<a
name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38"
class="fnanchor">38</a> In its best form it consisted of a bowl
having a perpendicular rod or staff erected at the central
point of the inner curved surface. This rod cast a shadow
upon the inner surface of the bowl, which had been
graduated, giving a reading in degrees which furnished to
the observer the information desired. Time brought
improvements and variations in the construction of simple
instruments of this character. As early as the third century
before the Christian era, adjustable rings, or armillae, for
example, were employed by astronomers to aid them in the
solution of their problems, which instruments later
developed, as noted below, into the more elaborate and
complex armillary spheres. The simplest form of such an
instrument appears to have been but a single graduated
circle. To this, at a very early date, a second was added,
thus providing an instrument in which one of the circles was
regarded as fixed in the plane of the equator, the other,
intersecting this at right angles, served as a meridian
circle, being movable around an axis which could be called
the world axis, the axis of the celestial sphere, or the
axis of the universe. The position of a celestial body in
declination could be determined on the meridian circle, and
its right ascension on the fixed or horizon circle.<a name=
"FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> It seems altogether
probable that Eratosthenes made use of such an instrument in
his efforts to measure the obliquity of the ecliptic. He
tells us that in his time one of large dimensions hung in
the portico of the academy of Alexandria.<a
name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40"
class="fnanchor">40</a> With the addition of other circles, and
of an adjustable view-tube, that more accurate and detailed
measurements might be made, this device, in Hipparchus&#8217; day,
came to be known as an astrolabe, and, after the addition of
other rings in later years, to be known as an armillary
sphere. Even in this last development it was not a true
sphere on which could be represented the starry
constellations, but an arrangement of circles forming a sort
of imaginary sphere, the circles being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span> intended to
represent the relative position of the principal celestial
circles. This instrument seems, at first, to have been
suspended, when in use, but later was made to rest upon a
base, the whole adjusted to revolve around an axis and
within a graduated horizon circle. In the earliest examples,
the earth at the center of the circles, it represented the
Ptolemaic system (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f9">9</a>); in the later examples,
having the sun at the center, it represented the Copernican
system.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;9. Armillary Sphere according to Ptolemy.</p></div>

<p>It is expressly stated by Ptolemy that a celestial globe was
constructed by Hipparchus, who is reputed to have been the
founder of spherical trigonometry,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41"
class="fnanchor">41</a> and Pliny tells us that Hipparchus was
the inventor of the astrolabe,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> which statement probably
means that he greatly improved the simple armillae used at
an earlier date as an instrument for astronomical
calculations.</p>

<p>Ptolemy, in his &#8216;Syntaxis,&#8217; or &#8216;Almagest&#8217; as it was called
by the Arabs, devoted a chapter to the method of
constructing, and to the use of the astrolabe, which must
have closely resembled the armillary sphere, describing
therein, in terms not altogether easy of comprehension, its
several rings and cylinders, and the method of adjusting the
same for purposes of determining the latitude and the
longitude of celestial bodies. He tells us also how to
construct a representation of the sphere of the fixed stars
by means of a solid ball, how to place thereon the several
constellations, and how to use the same in the study of
astronomical problems. Such a globe, he says, &#8220;should be of
a dark color, that it might resemble the night and not the
day.&#8221; His description is detailed as to the proper method of
procedure in marking the position of the celestial circles
on this globe, in arranging the movable rings of &#8220;hard and
well polished material,&#8221; in graduating the rings and
adjusting them to move about an axis which is likewise an
axis of the globe proper. In marking the position of the
fixed stars, we are told that the proper method is to
commence at some constant and invariable point of a certain
constellation, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span> suggests that the best starting
point is the fixed star in Canis Major, that is, the
so-called dog star, or Sirius. &#8220;The position of the other
fixed stars, as they follow in the list, could easily be
determined,&#8221; he says, &#8220;by making the globe to turn upon the
poles of the zodiac, thus bringing the graduated circle to
the proper point of each. The stars could be marked with
yellow or with such other color as one might choose, having
due regard for their brilliancy and magnitude. The outline
of each of the constellations should be made as simple as
possible, indicating with light strokes, differing but
little in color from that of the surface of the globe, the
figures which the stars in the several constellations
represent, preserving in this manner the chief advantage of
such representation, which should be to make the several
stars very prominent without destroying, by a variety of
color, the resemblance of the object to the truth. It will
be easy to make and to retain a proper comparison of the
stars if we represent upon the sphere the real appearance or
magnitude of the several stars. While neither the equator
nor the tropics can be represented on the globe, it will not
be difficult to ascertain the proper position of these
circles. The first could be thought of as passing through
that point on the graduated meridian circle which is 90
degrees from the poles. The points on this meridian circle
23 degrees 51 minutes (<i>sic</i>) each side of the equator will
indicate the position of the tropics, that toward the north
the summer solstitial circle, that toward the south the
winter solstitial circle. With the revolution of the globe
from east to west, as each star passes under the graduated
meridian circle, we should be able to ascertain readily its
distance from the equator or from the tropics.&#8221;<a

<p>That the Romans especially interested themselves in globes,
either celestial or terrestrial, is not at all probable,
because of their very practical inclinations. There is
evidence, however, that in the time of the emperors
celestial globes were constructed, especially in the studios
of sculp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>tors, but these were made largely for decorative
purposes, having therefore an artistic rather than a
scientific value. In the year 1900 there was found in a
villa at Boscoreale, not far from Pompeii, an interesting
fresco (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f10">10</a>), this being acquired by the
Metropolitan Museum of New York in the year 1903. It has
been referred to as a sundial, but was clearly intended to
represent, in outline, a globe exhibiting the prominent
parallels and a certain number of the meridians. It is not
at all improbable that such subjects were frequently
selected for wall or floor decoration.<a name="FNanchor_44"
id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> It appears that astrologers at times
made use of globes in forecasting events.<a
name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45"
class="fnanchor">45</a> It may further be noted that on certain
early Roman coins there may be found the representation of a
globe (Figs. <a href="#f11">11</a>, <a href="#f12">12</a>), which perhaps had as its prime
significance the representation of universal dominion.<a

<p>Not until the day of the Byzantine Emperors do we meet with
a real scholar who made a particular study of such
astronomical apparatus, apparatus which he describes in a
special treatise. Among historical scholars the work of
Leontius Mechanicus seems not to have found the recognition
which it deserves.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> He appears to have been a practical
man, very active within the field concerning which he wrote,
and from his remarkably detailed description we are able to
learn something of the extent to which globe technique was
carried in the days of the early Eastern Emperors. We at any
rate learn from him that globes were constructed in his
workshop, which globes, in all important respects, were like
those in use at the present time, being, for example,
provided with a meridian circle adjusted to move through
notches in a horizon circle. The information given us by
Leontius, which here follows, is in free translation or
paraphrase of his treatise, the whole being condensed. He
appears to have been a student of astronomy, as represented
by Aratus, for he tells us that he had endeavored to
construct a globe on which the constellations and the
circles could be made to conform to the records of<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span> the ancient poet astronomer.
He tells us further that he constructed this globe for
Elpidius, an estimable man of letters, and one full of zeal
for study; that at the time of its construction, though he
had the leisure, he did not prepare a description of the
globe, but on the insistence of his friends such description
he now proposed to write. This appears to be the <i>raison
d&#8217;&ecirc;tre</i> for his treatise. The importance of adhering
closely to the statements of Aratus he insists upon, though
admitting that writer&#8217;s errors, being convinced that most of
the globes of which one had knowledge in his day agreed
neither with him nor with Ptolemy. Leontius first directs
attention to Aratus&#8217; threefold plan in describing the
several constellations, in which description that author
speaks first of the relation which part bears to part in
each; second, of the position of each constellation relative
to the celestial circles, as, for example, to the tropics,
and third, its position in the heavens relative to the
constellations in the zodiac. He follows this statement with
a somewhat lengthy reference to the constellation Ophiuchus,
or the Serpent, in explanation of the method of description.
After having the surface of the globe portioned out for the
representation of the several constellations and the
important circles, he then proceeds, as he states, to
consider the execution, by which he means representing in
proper color and outline the several figures, and the
mounting of the globe. Upon a properly constructed support
should first be placed the horizon circle, through which a
second circle should be made to pass; this second circle
will serve as a meridian. These circles, he observes, will
enclose the ball, all the points of the surface of which
should be equally distant from the inner surface of the
horizon and meridian circles, that is, there should be a
perfect adjustment of the enclosing rings and the enclosed
ball. The surface of the sphere should be painted a dark
color, as, for example, azure. He sets forth, with
considerable detail, the proper method of procedure in
locating the several principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span> circles, each of which
should be graduated. The zodiac should be divided into
twelve parts, and the constellations belonging to each of
the several parts should be designated by name, beginning
with Cancer, following this with Leo, Virgo, and so on, one
after the other. In giving the globe a position which
actually conforms to the world, the pole should be set to
the north, and the movement of the sky can then be imitated
by turning the globe to the left. Leontius, by way of
summary and definition, at the conclusion of his treatise,
speaks of a sphere as a solid having a surface, from all the
points of which, if straight perpendicular lines of equal
length be drawn, they will reach a point within called the
center. This center in the great sphere of the universe is
the earth. The poles of the sphere are the extremities of
the axis on which it turns. The horizon cuts the sphere into
two hemispheres, the one superior and the other inferior to
the earth. The sky, which is continually turning, encircles
all, one half of it being above, the other below the earth,
which is as far removed from the superior part of the
heavens as from the inferior.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><b>N</b> passing from the period of classical antiquity to the
so-called Christian middle ages, attention may first be
directed to the activities of the Arabs in the field of
astronomy and geography, in so far as their activities had
to do with the construction of globes.<a name="FNanchor_49"
id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> The information which we have,
concerning their astronomical studies in particular, is more
detailed than is that which has come down to us respecting
any other peoples who may have been interested in these
centuries in the same field of study.</p>

<p>Doubt may be expressed at the outset that the Arabs were
interested in the construction of terrestrial globes, since
with the matter of descriptive geography they appear to have
been very little concerned, a fact which their imperfect
cartographical attempts clearly demonstrate.<a
name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50"
class="fnanchor">50</a> Although the theory of a globular earth
was early accepted by their learned men,<a
name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51"
class="fnanchor">51</a> there is scarcely a trustworthy
allusion in literature to Arabic terrestrial globes which
can be cited. An occasional reference, however, has been
made by modern writers to a globe said to have been
constructed for King Roger of Sicily. Without citing his
authority, Freyheer F. v. Zach states that &#8220;the oldest
terrestrial globe which is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>known was made for King Roger
II of Sicily in the twelfth century, and is especially
remarkable for the value of the metal which was used in its
construction, this being 400 pounds of silver. A knowledge
of this globe would not have come down to our day had not
Edrisi, a famous geographer of that time, given an especial
description of the same, under the title Nothatol mostak
(Pleasure of the Soul).&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> It is probable that the reference
here is to a circular disc made by Edrisi, or an armillary
sphere, but not to a terrestrial globe.<a name="FNanchor_53"
id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>As to Arabic celestial globes, a different situation
presents itself. It is well known that the inhabitants of
Arabia, long before the time of Islam, were in the habit of
observing the stars, many of which, as Dorn has noted, they
knew and designated by names taken from pastoral life, and
several of which they worshiped as visible gods.<a
name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54"
class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>Calif al-Mansur, who began his reign in 754 A.&nbsp;D., appears
to have been the first to show a decided taste for
astronomical science, and for many centuries following him
this interest is strikingly pronounced among the people of
his country.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> Scholars were eagerly attracted to the works
of Ptolemy, which were many times translated into Arabic,
and commentaries were written upon his description of the
names and figures of the several constellations. The only
alteration they allowed themselves to make in the names of
the stars was to translate them into their own language, or
to substitute for those they could not understand other
names that conveyed an idea to their minds, applicable to
the constellation before the eyes. Andromeda they called
&#8220;The Chained Lady&#8221;; Cassiopeia they called &#8220;The Lady in the
Chair&#8221;; Orion received the name &#8220;The Giant.&#8221; They followed
in the construction of their armillary spheres and celestial
globes the description laid down in Ptolemy&#8217;s &#8216;Syntaxis,&#8217;
modifying these astronomical instruments, from time to time,
as their studies directed them.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>The list of califs interested in astronomy is a long one,
both of those who remained in the original homeland, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>of those who went to the new home in the Iberian
Peninsula.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> The Mohammedan Hulagu Khan, for example,
erected, about 1264, an observatory in his Mongol capital,
Maragha, near Tabriz, which long remained a noted center for
astronomical studies.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> This observatory, however, was but
one of a number of similar institutions erected either by
the Arabs or by the Persians. We are told that the
construction of astronomical instruments was brought to a
high degree of perfection by these peoples in the thirteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> The names of many of the Arabic astronomers who
were particularly expert as globe makers are recorded, and
there were many who wrote on the subject of celestial
spheres, armillary spheres, and astrolabes, even before the
tenth century.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> The author of the &#8216;Fihrist,&#8217; Ibn Ab&icirc;
Ja&#8217;k&ucirc;b an-Nad&icirc;m, tells us that Kurra ben
Kam&icirc;t&acirc; al-Harr&acirc;n&icirc; constructed a
globe which he himself had seen.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> This, he says, was made
of unbleached material from Dabik, and colored, but that the
colors were much faded. Ibn Alnabdi, who was known as a
clever mechanic, mentions two globes which he had examined
and admired for their excellency of execution, in the public
library of Kahira, in the year 1043. One of these globes, he
says, was made of brass, by Ptolemy himself; the other, of
silver, was constructed by Abul Hassan Alsufi, for the
immediate use of the king, Adad Eddoula.<a
name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62"
class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>As a visible evidence of the interest of the Arabs in
astronomical science, and of their skill in the construction
of astronomical instruments, we have preserved to us,
besides numerous astrolabes, no less than seven globes,
known to have been constructed prior to the year 1600. The
oldest one extant is now in the possession of the R.
Istituto di Studi Superiori of Florence, Italy.<a
name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63"
class="fnanchor">63</a> This fine example of the skill which
was attained by the instrument makers of Valencia, Spain, at
one time a flourishing center of Arabic culture, appears to
date from the second half of the eleventh century. According
to an inscription on the globe, we learn that it was made at
Valencia by Ibrahim Ibn Said-as-Sahli, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>in the year 473 of
the Hegira, a date equivalent to 1080 A.&nbsp;D. This date
Professor Meucci finds confirmed by a careful study of the
position of the stars represented on the globe. He notes,
for example, that the star Regulus had been placed at a
distance of 16 degrees 40 minutes from the sign of Leo.
Ptolemy, in the year 140 A.&nbsp;D., gave this distance as 2
degrees 30 minutes. According to Albaregnius, this star
advances about one degree every sixty-six years. Since 140
A.D. the star, therefore, would have moved 14 degrees 10
minutes, which fact would lead astronomers to place this
star, about 1080, as it appears on the globe. The globe is
of brass, 20 cm. in diameter, having engraved on its surface
forty-seven constellations, as given by Ptolemy, omitting
only the Cup, with 1042 stars, each with its respective
magnitude indicated.</p>

<p>A second Arabic celestial globe, which dates from the year
1225, has been described in detail in a monograph by
Assemani, which he issued in the year 1790.<a
name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64"
class="fnanchor">64</a> This remarkably interesting object
belonged, at the time, to the extensive and celebrated
collection of antiquities and curiosities of Cardinal
Borgia, in Velletri, but may now be found in the Museo
Nazionale of Naples. It is composed of two brass
hemispheres, having both horizon and meridian circles, the
whole resting upon four supporting feet. A Cufic inscription
tells us that it was made by Caissar ben Abul Casem ben
Mosafer Alabiaki Alhanefi, in the year of the Hegira 622.
Caissar probably was an astronomer at the court of Cairo,
and the Mohammedan date as given, translated into Christian
reckoning, gives us the year 1225.</p>

<p>In the year 1829 Dorn published a detailed description of an
Arabic globe which had been deposited in the museum of the
Asiatic Society of London (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f13">13</a>) by Sir John
Malcolm.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> It is of brass, has a diameter of 24 cm., and is
furnished with a substantial mounting. The peculiar features
of the figures which represent the several constellations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>suggest Persian workmanship.&nbsp;In the vicinity of the
south pole is an inscription in Cufic characters, telling us
that it was &#8220;Made by the most humble in the supreme god,
Mohammed ben Helal, the astronomer of Monsul, in the year of
the Hegira 674.&#8221; This year answers to the year 1275 of the
Christian era, that is, it was constructed about the same
time as the Borgian globe and that belonging to the Dresden
collection, briefly described below. Forty-seven
constellations are represented. On the horizon circle, in
their respective places, we find engraved the words, &#8220;East,&#8221;
&#8220;West,&#8221; &#8220;South,&#8221; &#8220;North.&#8221;</p>

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;13. Northern Hemisphere of Globe by Mohammed ben
Helal, 1275.</p></div>

<p>The Arabic globe, to be found in the Mathematical Salon of
Dresden (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f14">14</a>), has proved to be one of much
interest and scientific value to students of astronomy.<a
name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> Bode, who described
it in the year 1808, refers to its remarkably fine execution
and to its Cufic inscriptions as being among the finest
extant specimens of early Arabic writing. The sphere is of
brass, having a diameter of 14 cm., and is composed of two
parts, separable on the line of the ecliptic. It has a brass
horizon circle, on which is engraved at the east the word
&#8220;rising,&#8221; and at the west the word &#8220;setting.&#8221; It is not
supplied with a movable meridian circle, but within the
horizon circle, from north to south, and from east to west,
there are two brass half circles, of the same diameter as
the horizon circle and so adjusted as to form one piece with
it. Through such an arrangement it is made possible to turn
the globe in any desired direction, one half of it being at
all times above the horizon. In addition to the above
arrangement, there are two movable half circles, attached at
the zenith point by a pivot. These half circles are
graduated, and are movable, making it possible to find, by
means of them, the declination and right ascension of any
star. The base, which must be comparatively modern, consists
of a circular plate, from which rise four turned support
columns, attached at their upper extremities to the two half
circles of brass, on which rests the horizon circle.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;14. Globe of Mohammed ben Muwajed el Ordhi, 1279.</p>
</div>

<p>The date of construction cannot be far from 1279, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>is determinable from the position of the stars engraved
thereon, relative, for example, to the equinoctial points.
The maker&#8217;s name, &#8220;Mohammed ben Muwajed el Ordhi,&#8221; appears
near the constellation Ursa Major, and is inlaid in silver.
There appear, very artistically engraved, the lines
representing the principal circles, the outlines of the
several constellations, with their names, some of these
being inlaid with silver, some with gold. The equator and
the ecliptic are represented on the surface of the sphere,
each by two engraved parallel lines, and are graduated, the
graduation in each instance being represented by four short
and one long line, alternating thus by fives throughout the
entire three hundred and sixty degrees. The equator is
inlaid with gold, the other circles with silver. The names
of the twelve constellations in the zodiac are alternately
inlaid with gold and silver, while all star names, except as
indicated, are inlaid with silver. The constellations
represented number forty-eight, the human figures all being
clad, turning the front and right face toward the observer.</p>

<p>The Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale of Paris possesses two
ancient Arabic globes, one of which, neither signed nor
dated, has been thought to have been constructed in the
eleventh century.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> This was obtained by Jomard, in Egypt,
more than sixty years ago. It has a diameter of about 19
cm., is furnished with a horizon circle, which is upheld by
four semicircular arms, these, in turn, resting upon a base
composed of four flat and rather inartistic supports. The
engraving on the surface of the brass sphere closely
resembles that on the Dresden globe. A detailed description
of this globe has not been obtainable.</p>

<p>A second Paris Arabic globe,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> like the preceding, belongs
to the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f15">15</a>). It has
a diameter of something less than 15 cm., and was
constructed by Diemat Eddin Mohammed, in the year of the
Hegira 981, which in the Christian reckoning corresponds to
the year 1573.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>The Imperial Library of Petrograd possesses an Arabic
globe, constructed in the year 1701.<a name="FNanchor_69"
id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> It is described by Dorn as a fine
example of the globe maker&#8217;s art, closely resembling, in its
general features, the Arabic globe in the collection of the
Royal Asiatic Society of London. It has a diameter of about
19 cm., rests upon an ornamental tripod base, and is
adjusted to turn within a brass circle, which circle is
fitted into a larger one, so marked and graduated as to
represent four concentric circles. The first or inner
circle, representing the horizon, is divided into thirty-six
divisions of ten degrees each; on the second circle the
degrees are indicated by letters; on the third circle appear
the twelve signs of the zodiac and the four principal
directions, east, west, north, south; the fourth circle is
divided into thirty-six parts, formed by the extension of
the lines which divide the first, or horizon circle, into
thirty-six parts. On the last circle the names of one
hundred and four cities and countries are given. Not far
from the north pole is an inscription which gives us the
name of the maker and the date of construction. Therein we
read that it was completed in the year 1113 of the flight of
the Prophet, or in the year 1701 of Christian reckoning, by
Ridhwan, for Maulana Hassan Efendi, who, toward the end of
the seventeenth century, was director of the astronomical
observatory of Cairo, and gave substantial encouragement to
makers of globes and of other instruments employed in
astronomical studies. The equator, the ecliptic, and the
parallels are represented, the first two by parallel circles
which are crossed or joined by lines dividing them into
seventy-two principal parts, each part being again
subdivided into fifths. The close resemblance of this
example to the earlier known Arabic globes suggests that
there was little, if any, progress among those peoples in
the art of globe construction since the eleventh century.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span><b>OR</b> many centuries following the fall of the Western Roman
Empire, there appears to have been in Christian Europe but
little interest in the fundamental principles of
geographical or astronomical science. The theories of the
Greeks and the Romans respecting a spherical earth and a
spherical firmament encompassing it, in illustration of
which they had constructed globes, were not entirely
forgotten, but such theories in general were considered to
be valueless, hindrances rather than helps to the
theological beliefs of the new Christian era.<a name=
"FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>Though the early Church Fathers were inclined to reject the
idea of a globular earth,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> there were not a few among them
who found the theory of a circular earth an acceptable one.
The latter, it is true, was an early Greek belief, referred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>to above as having been entertained in Homer&#8217;s day, and as
having been passed down to succeeding centuries, but
Christian writers did not find in the fact of its pagan
origin a particular argument for accepting it; on the
contrary, the Bible was held by many to be the fountain of
all knowledge, and a sure guide no less in the solution of
problems pertaining to the physical sciences than in the
solution of problems pertaining to faith and doctrine. What
was contained in the Scriptures found a more ready
acceptance than what was to be found in pagan writers.<a
name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> Isaiah&#8217;s statement,
&#8220;It is He that sitteth upon the circle of the earth,&#8221; was
regarded as one altogether adequate on which to found a
theory of the form of the earth, and it was accepted by such
biblical interpreters as Lactantius, Cosmas Indicopleustes
(Figs. <a href="#f16">16</a>, <a href="#f17">17</a>), Diodorus of Tarsus, Chrysostom, Severian of
Gabala, by those who were known as the Syrians, by Procopius
and Decuil.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> Men, however, such as Basil, Gregory of Nyssa,
and Philoponos inclined strongly toward the Aristotelian
doctrine of a spherical earth.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> Isidore of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>Seville appears to have been
a supporter of the spherical doctrine,<a name="FNanchor_75"
id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> as was also the Venerable Bede, who, in
his &#8216;De natura rerum,&#8217; upholds the doctrine of a spherical
earth on practically the same grounds as those advanced by
Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>In illustration of the doctrine of a circular earth,
terrestrial globes certainly could not have been thought of
as having any practical value. With a rejection of the
spherical theory of the ancients very naturally went the
rejection of their globes.</p>

<p>The circular or Homeric theory, as noted above, had its
supporters, even to the close of the middle ages, but the
inclination is more or less marked, even as early as the
seventh century, to accept again the doctrine of a spherical
earth. It seems to have come into prominence again with the
growing belief in the importance of the place of the earth
in the universe. After the eighth century this theory may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>said to have had a very general acceptance by those who,
Faust-like, felt a desire for a larger freedom from
theological restraint than the church encouraged. (Figs. <a href="#f18">18</a>,

<p>Attention has been called to the attitude of the writings of
the Anglo-Saxon Church Father, the Venerable Bede. Although
we have no unquestionable proof that Bede, or Alcuin,<a
name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> who was greatly
influenced by him, insisted on the use of globes in
geographical instruction, there is good reason for thinking
these scholars would have inclined to encourage their use.
The monastic schools, which, in the methods of instruction,
rested upon the plan wrought out by Alcuin for the Palace
School of Charles the Great, considered globes to be
apparatus of great educational value. Professor G&uuml;nther
is inclined to think it probable that celestial globes were
used throughout the early centuries of this mediaeval period
in the better schools, though no positive statement to that
effect can be cited.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>We know that an exact knowledge of the movements of the sun,
of the moon, and of the constellations was considered to be
of first importance for the priesthood in the middle ages,
since it was through a knowledge of their movements that the
times for the observance of the rigid church rules were
fixed.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> The acquisition of such knowledge could best be
secured through the use of the celestial globe.<a
name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80"
class="fnanchor">80</a> We learn from Notker Labeo (950-1022),
one of the most distinguished teachers of the monastic
school of St. Gallen, that he made use of such globes for
astro-geographical instruction, which, in their important
features, were like our modern celestial globes, for he
tells us &#8220;they were supplied with all necessary parts.&#8221; It
seems evident that those of which he made use could be
adjusted to every desired altitude of the pole.<a
name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>One of the most distinguished scholars of the tenth century
was Bishop Gerbert (ca. 940-1003), later Pope Sylvester II,
of whose learning we possess reliable evidence.<a name=
"FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> His astronomical knowledge
so astonished his contemporaries that he was thought to be a
necromancer and was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>accused of being in league with the
evil one.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> He was a diligent student of the literature of
antiquity, which had survived to his day, especially
surpassing all others, it is reported, in his acquaintance
with the learning of pagan Rome. In the instruction which he
gave in astronomical science he made use of various
instruments, to the end that his pupils might the better
understand the subject, among which instruments were
celestial globes and armillary spheres. These were a source
of much wonderment to his contemporaries. It is said that
one of these instruments was so skilfully constructed that
even the untrained by its use, having one constellation
pointed out, would be able to locate all others &#8220;with the
aid of a globe and without the aid of a teacher.&#8221;<a
name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84"
class="fnanchor">84</a> In a letter to the monastic teacher
Constantius, with whom Gerbert stood in the friendliest
relations for many years at Rheims, he refers to the
construction of a celestial globe, and in a more detailed
manner he makes mention of this when writing to Remigius of
Trier. In four of his letters to this last named prelate,
Gerbert touches upon his purpose to construct a globe, but
on account of the added duties which were his, occasioned by
the death of Archbishop Adalbero, he seems not to have been
able to complete his work. He expresses himself, in the
third one of these letters, as hopeful that a favorable time
might yet come for him to take up the plan, but the
increasing opposition of his enemies left him no leisure for
scientific labors of this character, and it does not appear
that he turned his attention again to globe making.<a
name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85"
class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>The thirteenth century furnishes us with the names of two
distinguished princes who were especially active in
advancing scientific studies of their times. One of these
was the Hohenstaufen Frederick II, concerning whom we are
informed that he directed a learned Arabian, who sojourned
at his court, to construct for him a celestial globe of gold
on which the stars were to be represented by pearls.<a
name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86"
class="fnanchor">86</a> We <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>are further told that as an
outcome of his friendly relations with the rulers of the
East, the Sultan of Egypt sent to him an astronomical tent
of wonderful construction. In this the sun and the moon were
represented and by means of a skilfully constructed
mechanism they were made to rise and set, marking out the
hours of day and night.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>As a ruler of like intellectual and scientific interests,
the Castilian, Alfonso X, who lived in the thirteenth
century, known as &#8220;The Wise&#8221; and as &#8220;The Astronomer,&#8221;
deserves to be especially mentioned. By his order an
elaborate astronomical work was prepared, which holds a
place of first importance among mediaeval productions of its
character. In this work the construction of globes is
discussed in a very detailed manner, mention being made of
every feature regarded as belonging to a properly
constructed celestial sphere. So significant are certain
chapters of this work for the history of globes and of globe
making that a free translation is here given of that part
relating to materials of which globes may be constructed.<a
name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88"
class="fnanchor">88</a> &#8220;A sphere may be made of many
materials,&#8221; says the author, &#8220;as of gold, or silver, or
copper, or brass, or iron, or lead, or tin, or of a
combination of these metals; or they may be made of stone,
or clay, or wood. They may also be made of leather, of
cloth, of parchment in many layers, and of many other
materials which men employ when they wish to give an
exhibition of their skill. Those, however, who have
carefully considered these things, have decided that there
is nothing more suitable than wood and for the following
reasons. If the globe should be made of gold, only a very
rich man would be able to possess it; furthermore it would
be very heavy. If it should be made of thin sheets of gold
it could be easily indented and would not long remain a
perfect sphere. If it should be made small, that which was
represented thereon would not appear distinct. The same
thing may be said of silver, although it is a metal stronger
than gold, as it is likewise harder, and therefore is not so
easily indented. Copper is a metal harder than either silver
or gold, but is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>so dry that it can not be easily fashioned
into a globe, which should always be well made. Brass, which
is like dark colored copper, may be more easily fashioned,
because it is more malleable than copper, and is stronger
than either gold or silver. If, however, a globe made of
this material should be thin it might easily lose its shape,
and if thick it would be very heavy. Of all metals, however,
this is the one most suitable for use in making spheres, as
it is the one most commonly employed. A globe of iron would
be very difficult to make and would be very heavy, and since
the rust would have to be removed from it very frequently,
there would be much danger of destroying the figures. A
globe of tin, if made of a thin sheet, could be easily
indented, and would be very heavy if the sheet of which made
were thick. Lead, if thin, would offer less resistance to
injury than tin, and is a material much heavier.
Furthermore, as lead is inclined to turn black, the figures
and the stars represented on a globe of this material would
soon become so discolored as to be no longer visible. There
is no way by which it can be cleaned without wiping out the
figures. Although the metal could be combined to form that
material of which water jugs and buckets are made it would
be so fragile as to break like glass. Clay, which is also
used for the making of water jugs, mortars, and fountains,
is not suitable for globes, because if thin it would break
easily, and if thick it would be very heavy. Moreover this
material when prepared must be baked in a kiln which fact
renders it unsuitable for use in making spheres. A globe
should not be made of stone, since if this were transparent
the figures could not easily be seen, and such material
would be very heavy. It would not be fitting to make so
noble an object as a sphere of the material of which jars
are made. Leather would not be suitable, though it might be
fashioned into a permanent spherical shape. Such material
shrinks in hot weather or when brought near a fire. Cloth
would not be suitable, though it were made <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>very strong,
since heat would cause it to shrink, and moisture would
cause it to lose its shape, and this same thing may be said
of parchment. A sphere of wood is strong and is of
reasonable weight and may be made in the manner which we
shall set forth.&#8221; The original manuscript of this work is
profusely illustrated, including representations of the
figures of the several constellations (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f20">20</a>).</p>

<p>In the latter part of the thirteenth century the
mathematician, Giovanni Campano, a native of Novara and it
appears a particular friend and supporter of Pope Urban IV,
won distinction for his scholarly attainments in the field
of astronomy.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> In addition to his work, titled, &#8216;Teorica
planetarum,&#8217; wherein he comments on the subject of astronomy
and geometry, and makes copious references to the Greek
geometrician Euclid, whose works he had translated into
Latin, he prepared a treatise which he called &#8216;Tractatis de
sphera solida.&#8217; In the prologue to this work, after noting
that the number of astronomical instruments which have been
constructed is large, he states that in the main they agree
in their representation of the movements of the heavens,
adding that as the heavens are spherical, spherical
instruments are to be preferred. In his first chapter, after
alluding to the astronomical instruments described by
Ptolemy, he proceeds to treat of the composition of solid
spheres, which he says may be made of metal, or better, of
wood. He gives rules for making the same by the use of the
lathe, and notes in conclusion it is well to make the sphere
hollow in order to lighten the weight. In the following
chapters he treats of the inscription of the circles of the
sphere, of the construction of the several rings employed in
the mounting, such as the horizon and the meridian circles,
and gives consideration to the representation of the several
constellations on the surface of the ball. In the second
part of his treatise he gives instruction as to how to use
the instrument in the solution of astronomical problems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>There appears to be only the slightest evidence that
Campano was acquainted with the work of Alfonso. His
presentation of the subject, in all probability, was
altogether independent of a knowledge of the Alfonsian
tables. It is interesting to observe that in the day when
astrology was in great favor in the universities of Europe,
Campano continued to be interested in genuine astronomical
science.</p>

<p>Albertus Magnus, in his &#8216;Liber de coelo et mondo,&#8217;<a name=
"FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> devotes an entire chapter
to a theoretical consideration of gravitation, asserting
that the earth is spherical (Spherica sive orbicularis
necessario), and proceeds to a demonstration of the theory,
in which he practically follows the arguments of Aristotle,
that every particle of the earth away from the center is
continually in movement seeking that center, the result
being the formation of a spherical body. He advances
further, as argument in proof of a spherical earth, that the
shadow it casts in an eclipse of the moon is circular.</p>

<p>Sacrobosco (John of Holywood or Halifax) (fl. 1230),<a name=
"FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> who was active in the
first half of the thirteenth century, much of the time as
professor of mathematics in the University of Paris,
prepared a work bearing the title, &#8216;Tractatus de sphaera,&#8217;
being in part a summary of the &#8216;Almagest&#8217; of Ptolemy. In
this work the theory of a spherical earth is supported in
much the same manner as was done by Campano. The &#8216;Tractatus&#8217;
proved to be one of the most important quasi scientific
geographical and astronomical textbooks of the later middle
ages, being frequently copied, and frequently printed after
the invention of that art.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>Further reference might be made to a belief in a spherical
earth, as held by Roger Bacon (1214-1294),<a name=
"FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> by Thomas Aquinas
(1225-1274),<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> by Vincent of Beauvais (1190-1264),<a name=
"FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> by Dante (1265-1321),<a
name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96"
class="fnanchor">96</a> and still others of the thirteenth,
fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. It should, however, be
stated that nowhere in the works of these authors does there
appear a reference to the construction <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>of terrestrial
globes, and only incidentally the implication that they knew
of or approved the construction of celestial globes.</p>

<p>The increasing interest in geography and in astronomy in the
closing years of the middle ages led most naturally, in
time, to much activity in globe construction, and to this
fact attention is directed in the following chapter.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><b>HE</b> fourteenth century witnessed among the peoples of Italy
and of the Iberian coast regions a rapidly rising interest
in maritime enterprise. The expansion of Europe, which for
two centuries had been overland and eastward, was now
becoming oceanic, with an outlook southward and westward
into the Atlantic. In the fifteenth century, under the
inspiration of Prince Henry the Navigator, the Portuguese
were feeling their way down the coast of Africa, adding year
by year to their knowledge of hitherto unknown lands;<a
name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97"
class="fnanchor">97</a> the Atlantic island groups, one by one,
were discovered or rediscovered,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98"
class="fnanchor">98</a> and in 1487 Bartholomew Diaz turned the
Cape of Good Hope and opened a new way to the Indies of the
East.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> Through all these enterprises a new and vigorous
stimulus was given to interest in geographical studies, just
as an awakening had followed the disclosure of the riches of
the East by Carpini, Rubruquis, and especially by Marco Polo
in the earlier post-crusading years.<a name="FNanchor_100"
id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>Out of this lively interest in all that pertained to the
expansion of knowledge concerning the various regions of the
earth came a desire for better map making,<a name=
"FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> and attention was again
intelligently directed to the construction of terrestrial
globes on which to represent the most recently discovered
seas, islands, and continental coasts.</p>

<p>It was Martin Behaim of N&uuml;rnberg (1459-1507),<a name=
"FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> who, in so far as we
have knowledge, constructed one of the first modern
terrestrial globes (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f21">21</a>), and it may, indeed, be
said of his &#8220;Erdapfel,&#8221; as he called it, that it is the
oldest terrestrial globe extant. Behaim (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f22">22</a>)
belonged to the merchant class of a flourishing South German
city. He took advantage of the opportunities which were
offered him for travel, though it is hardly probable that he
is entitled to that renown as an African coast explorer with
which certain of his biographers have attempted to crown
him, nor does it appear that he is entitled to a very
prominent place among the men famed in his day for their
astronomical and nautical knowledge. It was doubtless for
reasons primarily commercial that he first found his way to
Portugal, where, shortly after his arrival, probably in the
year 1484, he was honored by King John with an appointment
as a member of a nautical or mathematical Junta. During his
earlier years in Portugal he was connected with one or more
expeditions down the coast of Africa, was knighted by the
king, presumably for his services, and made his home for
some years on the island of Fayal. In the year 1490 he
returned for a visit to his native city, N&uuml;rnberg, and
there is reason for believing that on this occasion he was
received with much honor by his fellow townsmen. It was the
suggestion of George Holzschuher, member of the City
Council, and himself somewhat famed as a traveler, that
eventually brought special renown to our globe maker, for he
it was who proposed to his colleagues of the Council that
Martin Behaim should be requested to undertake the
construction <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>of a globe on which the recent Portuguese
and other discoveries should be represented. From a record
on the globe itself, placed within the Antarctic circle, we
learn that the work was undertaken on the authority of three
distinguished citizens, Gabriel Nutzel, Paul Volckamer, and
Nikolaus Groland.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> It is an interesting fact that we are
able to follow in detail the construction of the globe
through its several stages, as the accounts of George
Holzschuher, to whom was entrusted the general supervision
of the work, have been preserved.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104"
class="fnanchor">104</a> From his report, presented at the
conclusion of the undertaking, we learn the names of those
who participated in the production of the globe; we learn
the amount received by each for his labors, and that the
total cost to the city for the completed product was
something less than seventy-five dollars. Information is
given therein as to the division of the work; how the
spherical shell was prepared; how the vellum covering was
fitted to the sphere; how the rings and the globe supports
were supplied; finally, how the artist, Glockenthon,
transferred the map to the prepared surface of the ball and
added to the same the several miniatures, illustrating in
rich color a variety of subjects.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;22. Portrait of Martin Behaim.</p></div>

<p>The globe, which still belongs to the Behaim family, was
removed in the year 1907, by Baron W. Behaim, from his
residence in Egedienplatz, N&uuml;rnberg, to the Germanic
Museum, where it may now be found. It originally stood on a
tripod base of wood, but this was later replaced by one of
iron. The iron meridian circle is doubtless the work of
Behaim himself, while its brass horizon circle probably
dates from the year 1510.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>In his scholarly work Ravenstein thus describes this
remarkable monument of a period in which there was a rapid
expansion of geographical knowledge. &#8220;The globe has a
circumference of 1595 mm., consequently a diameter of 507
mm. or 20 inches. Only two great circles are laid down upon
it, viz., the equator, divided into 360 degrees, and the
ecliptic studded with the signs of the zodiac. The Tropics,
the Arctic and the Antarctic circles are likewise <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>shown. The only meridian is drawn
from pole to pole 80 degrees to the west of Lisbon. The sea
is colored a dark blue, the land a bright brown or buff with
patches of green and silver, representing forests and
regions supposed to be buried beneath perennial ice and
snow. Perhaps the most attractive feature of the globe
consists of 111 miniatures, for which we are indebted to
Glockenthon&#8217;s clever pencil. The vacant space within the
Antarctic circle is occupied by a fine design of the
N&uuml;rnberg eagle with the virgin&#8217;s head, associated with
which are the arms of the three chief captains by whose
authority the globe was made.... There are, in addition, 48
flags (including 10 of Portugal) and 15 coats of arms, all
of them showing heraldic colors. The miniatures represent a
variety of subjects. Forty-eight of them show us kings
seated within tents or upon thrones; full-length portraits
are given of four Saints (St. Peter, St. Paul, St. Matthew,
and St. Iago), of missionaries instructing natives, and of
travelers. Eleven vessels float upon the sea, which is
peopled by fishes, seals, sea-lions, sea-cows, sea-horses,
sea-serpents, mermen, and a mermaid. The land animals
include elephants, leopards, bears, camels, ostriches,
parrots, and serpents.... The only fabulous beings which are
represented among the miniatures are a merman and a mermaid,
near the Cape Verde Islands, and two Sciapodes in central
South Africa, but syrens, satyrs, and men with dogs&#8217; heads
are referred to in some of the legends. Nor do we meet with
the &#8216;Iudei clausi,&#8217; or with a &#8216;garden of Eden,&#8217; still
believed in by Columbus.... The globe is crowded with over
1100 place names and numerous legends in black, red, gold,
or silver.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<p>The legends, in the South German dialect of the period, are
very numerous (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f23a">23</a>), and are of great interest to
students of history and of historical geography. The
following will serve to indicate the character of Behaim&#8217;s
numerous legends. &#8220;Nach cristi unsers lieben hern gepurt

southeast of the Azores Islands, reads in translation: &#8220;1431
years after the birth of our dear Lord, when there reigned
in Portugal the Infant Don Pedro, the infant Don Henry, the
King of Portugal&#8217;s brother, had fitted out two vessels and
found with all that was needed for two years, in order to
find out what was beyond the St. Jacob&#8217;s Cape of Finisterre.
The ships thus provisioned sailed continuously to the
westward for 500 German miles, and in the end they sighted
these ten islands. On landing they found nothing but a
wilderness and birds which were so tame that they fled from
no one. But of men or of four footed animals none had come
to live there because of the wildness, and this accounts for
the birds not having been shy. On this ground the islands
were called dos Azores, that is, Hawk Islands, and in the
year after, the king of Portugal sent sixteen ships with
various tame animals and put some of these on each island
there to multiply.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>The following legend relates to the islands of Antilia. &#8220;Als
man zelt nach cristi gepurt 734 jar als ganz hispania von
dn&#772; heiden auf affrica gewonon wurdt do wurdt bewont
di obgeschriben Insuln Antilia genant Septe citade von einem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>erzbischoff von porto portigal mit sech andern bischoffs
und andern cristen man und frawen dj zu sciff von hispanie
das geflohen kommen mit Irem vieh hab und gut anno 1414 ist
ein schiff aus hispania ungefert darbei gewest am negsten.&#8221;
&#8220;In the year 734 of Christ when the whole of Spain had been
won by the heathen of Africa, the above island Antilia
called Septa Citade (Seven Cities) was inhabited by an
archbishop from Porto in Portugal, with six other bishops
and other Christians, men and women, who had fled thither
from Spain by ship, together with their cattle, belongings
and goods. 1414 a ship from Spain got nighest it without
being endangered.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>Through the inspiration of Behaim the construction of globes
in the city of N&uuml;rnberg became a new industry to which
the art activities of the city greatly contributed. The
chief magistrate induced his fellow citizen to give
instruction in the art of making such instruments, yet this
seems to have lasted but a short time, for we learn that not
long after the completion of his now famous &#8220;Erdapfel,&#8221;
Behaim returned to Portugal, where he died in the year 1507.</p>

<p>Martin Behaim&#8217;s map of the world was drawn on parchment
which had been pasted over a large sphere. The Laon globe,<a
name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> apparently following
closely in time the former, is an engraved and gilded copper
ball, having a diameter of 17 cm. There is evidence that at
one time it was part of an astronomical clock.<a name=
"FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> The engraved surface,
on which appear the outlines of continents and islands, is
well preserved. It has two meridian circles, which intersect
at right angles and which can be moved about a common axis,
likewise a horizon circle which is movable. Numerous circles
appear engraved on the surface of the ball, including
meridians and parallels. The prime meridian passes through
the Madeira Islands, a fact which suggests a Portuguese
origin, since these islands are generally thought to have
been discovered by Lusitanian seamen. One hundred and eighty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>degrees east of this prime meridian, a second meridian is
engraved, equally prominent, passing through the middle of
the continent of Asia, and 90 degrees still farther to
eastward is a third. Each of these meridians is divided into
degrees, which are grouped in fifths and are numbered by
tens, starting at the equator. The meridians are intersected
by a number of parallels, lightly engraved in the northern
hemisphere, less distinct in the southern, and represent the
seven climates employed by the cosmographers of the Greek
and Roman period, as well as by those of the middle ages, in
their division of the earth&#8217;s surface.</p>

<p>As to its geographical representations, this terrestrial
globe appears to be older than that of Martin Behaim, yet at
the southern extremity of Africa we find the name &#8220;Mons
Niger,&#8221; inscribed with the legend &#8220;Huc usque Portugalenses
navigio pervenere 1493.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great enterprise of Christopher Columbus (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f24">24</a>),
wherein he may be said to have achieved a final victory for
the doctrine of a spherical earth, entitled his name to a
place of prominence in the history of terrestrial globes.
That Columbus himself constructed globes, as has been
sometimes inferred from a statement of Las Casas, may,
however, be questioned, since this statement touches the
reputed correspondence between Columbus and Toscanelli,
which correspondence, in the light of the very searching
studies of Mr. Henry Vignaud, must now be considered to be
of doubtful authenticity.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> It appears, however, from this
letter that the famous Italian cosmographer, Pauolo
Toscanelli, himself was accustomed to explain problems
arising in the field of discovery by the use of the globe,
and Las Casas tells us that Columbus resolved to write to
him, making known his intentions, which he desired to be
able to fulfil, and sent to him a globe through Lorenzo
Girardi, a Florentine, at that time residing in Lisbon.<a
name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a
href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> Ferdinand
Columbus, referring to this incident, says that &#8220;the globe
was a small one.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> In referring to Bartholomew, the son of
Christopher Columbus, Las Casas observes that &#8220;he was <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>a man of prudence and of
great intelligence in all matters pertaining to the seas. I
believe not much less learned in cosmography and in what
relates thereto, the making of navigator&#8217;s charts and globes
and other instruments of that kind.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_114"
id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> Again, we find in a letter which
Christopher Columbus directed to their Catholic Majesties,
that he &#8220;sent to their Majesties a certain round
representation.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> None of these references to globes, as
before stated, necessarily give us to understand that
Christopher Columbus was a globe maker. Certain it is that
none is now known attributed to him or to his son.</p>

<p>The explorer, John Cabot (1450-1498) (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f25">25</a>), is
likewise reputed to have been interested in the construction
of globes. In a dispatch sent from London, December 18,
1497, by the envoy Raimondi di Soncino to the Duke of Milan,
we read that &#8220;this Master John has a description of the
world on a map, and also on a solid sphere, which he has
made, and it shows where he landed, and that sailing toward
the east (west) he had passed far beyond the region of the
Tanais.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p>That terrestrial globes were constructed toward the close of
the fifteenth century is of significance, not only as a
response to a new desire for more nearly accurate
representation of the earth&#8217;s surface than could be set
forth on a plane map, but it is likewise significant by
reason of the fact that such globes as were constructed
served to demonstrate the value of globe maps, and this
value once demonstrated, they served to awaken a still
further interest in globe making, which bears abundant
fruitage in the following century.</p>

<p>There is a very remarkable celestial globe of the fifteenth
century now belonging to the Lyceum Library of Constance,
Switzerland. It is the work of Johannes St&ouml;ffler
(1452-1531),<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> at one time a pastor in the town of
Justingen, later a professor of mathematics in the
University of T&uuml;bingen, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>where he achieved renown as
mathematician, astronomer, cosmographer, and mechanic. It
appears from the title of a publication attributed to
St&ouml;ffler, &#8216;De artificiosa globi terrestris
compositione,&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> that he was a maker of terrestrial globes,
though no such globe of his is now known, and from his
letters to Reuchlin we learn that he made no less than three
celestial globes.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> One of the latter he sent to his
friend, Probst Peter Wolf of Denkendorf, which represented
the movements of the sun and of the moon. A second was
constructed for Bishop von Dalberg of Worms, on which the
stars were represented in gold.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120"
class="fnanchor">120</a> Nothing further is definitely known of
these two globes. A third was constructed for Bishop Daniel
of Constance, which is the one now to be found in that
city&#8217;s library.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> This sphere has a diameter of 48 cm.,
rests upon a wooden base, and is furnished with a meridian
and with a horizon circle. The forty-eight constellations of
Ptolemy are represented on a dark background and are
outlined in accord with recognized traditions. To a few of
the constellations double names are given, as &#8220;Hercules&#8221; and
&#8220;Genuflexus,&#8221; &#8220;Auriga&#8221; and &#8220;Agitator&#8221;. Stars of the first
magnitude are especially distinguished by name, the majority
of which are of Arabic origin, and more than one thousand
stars are clearly indicated.</p>

<p>To the globe makers themselves, who were active agents in
creating a demand for globes, there should here be added the
name of Conrad Celtes (1459-1508),<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122"
class="fnanchor">122</a> the distinguished German humanist, as
that of one who contributed most in the first years of
modern times toward arousing an interest in the use of
globes in the schools. Aschbach, in his History of the
Vienna University,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> tells us of the school founded in
Vienna in the year 1510 by the Emperor Maximilian I, and of
the instruction given in this school by Celtes. We are
informed that in his lectures on mathematical geography he
introduced a good text of Ptolemy in the original Greek;
this he translated into Latin, interpreting the same in
German, explaining the several sentences by reference to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>terrestrial and to a celestial globe. Having no record
that such a method had been earlier employed we may
therefore conclude that this distinguished teacher was the
first to proceed in the manner designated, that is, he was
the first in modern times to make use of globes in
geographical and astronomical instruction.</p>

<p>Of the above-named works, that by Ravenstein is the most
satisfactory, being a most scholarly and scientific
treatment of his subject. His work is indeed a monument in
the field of historical geography. Of the reproductions of
the globe map, none surpasses the excellent facsimile in the
form of globe gores which he prepared to accompany his
studies. With the utmost care he deciphered the numerous
legends and place names, admitting, here and there, the
possibility of inaccuracy in the readings due to the damaged
condition of the globe. Vignaud, H., in his Toscanelli and
Columbus, pp.&nbsp;182-186, gives a list of the numerous
reproductions of the globe map, with a brief word concerning
each. It may here be added that an excellent reproduction of
the globe, mounted as is the original, and made for Dr. W.
B. James of New York, in N&uuml;rnberg, the Ravenstein gores
being pasted over the prepared ball, may be seen in the map
department of The American Geographical Society. A similar
reproduction of the globe, with mounting of wood instead of
iron, was obtained by the author for exhibition in the Santa
Maria, Spain&#8217;s Official Replica of the Flagship of Admiral
Columbus, which was to have been exhibited in San Francisco
in 1915. It failed, however, to reach its destination, and
was returned to Chicago.</p></div>

The itemized statement of expenses, delivered to the
N&uuml;rnberg Council by George Holzschuher, was first
published by Peitz, J. (In: Mitteilungen des Vereins
f&uuml;r die Geschichte der Stadt N&uuml;rnberg, Heft 6.
N&uuml;rnberg, 1886.) It is of sufficient interest in the
history of globe making to be cited here. The translation is
Ravenstein&#8217;s, pp.&nbsp;111-112. &#8220;Expenditure on the globe.
Expenditure, N&uuml;rnberg, August 26, 1494. Below is to be
found a statement of what I, George Holzschuher have
expended by order of my lords of the city treasury, upon
limning and otherwise, for making the &#8216;apple,&#8217; or mappa
mundi in the shape of a sphere, and also for making the map
for the clerk&#8217;s office, which Mr. Marten Beham, having
expended thereon his art and pains, left behind for the
enjoyment of my lords of the worshipful council.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Item</i> first, to Glockenthon, who painted the sphere, and
spent 15 weeks over it, fl. 14; to his wife, fl. 1, facit, fl. 15, lb.-dn.-(&pound;2
10s.)</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Item</i> paid for a loam mould over which the sphere was to
have been made, as a guide for Kalberger, 28 dn.; also for
linen for the first sphere, 21 dn.; also for wine and beer,
and other things, for the limner&#8217;s dinner whilst painting
the globe, and occasionally also for Peham; and for bread
for cleansing the globe, and making it nice, fl. 1, lb. 1,
dn. 16; also to Gagenhart for lettering, 16 dn.; fecit,
miscellaneous expenses.</p>

<div class="center2">fl. 1, lb. 3, dn. 21 (14s. 5d.)</div>

<p>&#8220;<i>Item</i> paid Glockengiesser for a mould broken by Kalperger,
and round which Kalperger was to have made a large sphere,
both through N. Gross and M. Peham</p>
<div class="center2">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
fl. 2, lb.-, dn.- (&pound;1.)
</div>
<p>&#8220;<i>Item</i> paid for white vellum (parchment) covering the
sphere, 80 dn.; also for a cover lined with skin to protect
the sphere from dust, 3 lb., 20 dn.; also to the smith for
two iron hoops within which the sphere revolves, 4 lb. 6
dn.; also to the joiner for wooden stand of the sphere, 4
lb. 6 dn. facit, miscellaneous expenses</p>

<div class="center2">fl. 1, lb. 6, dn. 10 (17s. 7d.)</div>
<p>&#8220;<i>Item</i> paid to Mr. Marten Beham for a printed mappa mundi,
embracing the whole world, which was used for the globe, and
is to be hung in the town office, 1 fl. 3 lb.; also for
painting, etc., 1 fl.; also for lining and glueing
(mounting) the same, 5 lb. 10 dn.; also to the joiner for a
frame and two panels, 1 fl.; also to the starch painter for
painting these panels,</p>
<div class="center2">4 lb. 6 dn.; facit fl. 4, lb. 4, dn. 6 (&pound;2 5s.)
</div>
<p>&#8220;<i>Item</i>, Kalperger has not been paid for making the sphere:
he demands 3 fl., but owes for the linen which was used for
the old tent over the &#8216;beautiful fountain,&#8217; in return for
which he was to have made the large sphere; he had also
broken the pattern or mould for which 2 gulden (20s) had to
be paid to Glockengiesser; he also promised Mr. Merten that
if he taught him the art of cosmography or the laying out
(planning) of the globe he would make another sphere during
the time.&#8221;

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><b>ERRESTRIAL</b> globes of the early years of great geographical
discoveries, that is, of the fifteenth century, to which
reference was made in the preceding chapter, appear to have been
constructed either of metal, on the surface of which the map was
engraved, of which the Laon globe is an example; of a composition
fashioned into a ball over a mould on which strips of parchment
or paper were then pasted, having the map drawn by hand, as the
Behaim globe; or the ball was of wood with map in manuscript, as
was probably the globe attributed to John Cabot. Here were
beginnings, and the following century witnessed a remarkable
increase of interest in globe construction. <span class="figleft"

<span class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;26. Title-page of Johann Sch&ouml;ner&#8217;s
Terrae Descriptio, 1518.</span></span>As the true position of places
on the earth&#8217;s surface, as well as the distance between any two
places, could best be represented on a globe, cartographers and
globe makers became active in their endeavors to meet the desires
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">
60</a></span>of those interested in geography. They no longer
confined themselves to such globes as the Behaim and the Laon,
which, in reality, are artistically interesting rather than
scientifically useful, but they sought to make use of the new
invention of printing. Maps giving the outlines of continents,
with place names, rivers, constellations, and star names were
printed from wood blocks or from copper engraved plates on paper
gores, which were so fashioned mathematically that they could be
made to fit the surface of a prepared ball, with careful
adjustment and manipulation. In this manner globes in great
numbers could be prepared, with the added advantage that they
were all alike, or similar. The sixteenth century soon furnished
rules for globe-gore construction, and while the methods of globe
making hitherto common were not entirely given over, as many
artistic pieces of the period, which have come down to us,
testify, the new method was soon in general favor and became in
the course of time practically the only method employed. It is
the globe maker&#8217;s method today.</p>

<p>If the actual number of globes constructed shortly before
and shortly after 1500 appears to have been small,
judging from the number extant, we often find additional
assurance of interest in such instruments in the use that was
made of them for illustrative purposes, and for decoration.
Terrestrial and celestial globes, as well as armillart spheres,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">

interest in matters geographical, none was more conspicuous

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">
62</a></span>interesting letter dated Rome, January 17, 1509, and written by
Fioramonte Brognoli to Isabel of Este, wife of Francis II,
Marquis of Mantua, daughter of Hercules I, Duke of Ferrara, who
was responsible for the draughting of the Cantino map of the year
1502,<a name="FNanchor_126" id=
"FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class=

twenty-seven Ptolemy maps.<a name="FNanchor_127" id=
"FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class=
"fnanchor">127</a> Brognoli, having received from the
Marchioness an order for a copy of the globes, terrestrial and
celestial, possessed by Pope Julius II, made reply that &#8220;the map
and celestial signs which are painted on two solid spheres in the
library of the Pope, of which your Excellency would like to have
copies, I have ordered, and the same to be made by a good painter
of the Palace, who tells me that it will take some time because
the matter is quite difficult. I will not fail in care, and will
provide the necessary funds, so that as soon as possible I will
send them to you by a trusty messenger.&#8221;<a name=

"#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> Again the Roman

&#8220;That master painter who would like to make copies of the map and

Excellency wrote me some time ago, tells me that to make them
with linen it will cost more than forty ducats, but to draw them
on paper according to a certain design which is painted on canvas
in that place, it would cost very little. I thought I would
inform Your Excellency before giving the order, that I might
ascertain your wishes, for I shall do exactly that which you
desire.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_129" id=
"FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class=
"fnanchor">129</a> February 20, 1505, the Marchioness replied
from Mantua, saying that &#8220;the expense of forty ducats will not
deter us, if the copy of the map and of the zodiac is well made
and is similar to that found in the library of the Pope. You may
order it to be made with extreme diligence and with
exactness.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_130" id=

<p>The globe of Pope Julius II, in question, must then have been
constructed prior to 1505, seeing this to be the year of the
correspondence to which reference has been made <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>above.
From the partial description given in the letters we are led to
the conclusion that they were not engraved metal globes, but
their maps were manuscript, and were well decorated by hand. The
Vatican Museum is still in possession of a celestial globe which
may well be one of those once belonging to Pope Julius II, the
terrestrial globe having disappeared. From the interesting
description of Denza<a name="FNanchor_131" id=
"FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class=
"fnanchor">131</a> we learn that this remaining one is a hollow
wooden ball, 95 cm. in diameter. That there might be an even
surface on which to draw the star map, a covering of plaster had
been provided, 4 mm. in thickness. It is furnished with a
somewhat elaborate base, ornamented with sphinxes with the heads
of eagles and the feet of lions. Its horizon circle, supported by
four quarter circles, is a band 5 cm. wide, the surface of which
is divided into five concentric circles, within which are the
names of the several signs of the zodiac in Latin, the names of
the days of the month, and the names of the eight principal winds
in the Italian language. Along the outer edge of this horizon
circle is the following inscription, &#8220;Daniel Chassignet. Fecit.
Romae 1617,&#8221; a name and date clearly applying only to this circle
or to the globe&#8217;s mounting. It has a meridian circle within which
the sphere revolves. On the surface of the ball we find
represented the principal circles, that is, the equator, the
tropics, the polar circles, with five meridians, and the
ecliptic, its twelve signs being represented in gilded
characters. The coat of arms, painted near the south pole, is not
that of Pope Julius II, but of Cardinal Gian Stefano Ferrero,
Bishop of Bologna, who became a supporter of Juliani della Rovere
in his candidacy for the papal office, and to which office he was
elected, becoming known as Julius II. Fiorini thinks it probable
that the globe was presented by Cardinal Ferrero to the Pope, and
that while in his possession the coat of arms was painted on its
surface. It is indeed not improbable that it was originally
constructed for the Cardinal. Contrary to the
opinion of Denza, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>Fiorini&#8217;s conclusion is that the
decoration of the globe is not to be attributed to Giulio
Romano, a distinguished pupil of Raphael, and the arguments
presented seem acceptable.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>As proof of an existing interest in globes, in Italy, in the
first years of the sixteenth century, other than that given by
the letters of Isabel of Este, and the globes of Pope Julius, we
find an allusion to the subject by Friar Marco da Benevento,
member of the order of Celestini and a renowned mathematician. In
his &#8216;Orbis nova descriptio,&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_133" id=
"FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class=
"fnanchor">133</a> which he added to an edition of Ptolemy,
issued in Rome in the year 1507 or 1508, he alludes to the
difficulty of representing the earth upon a solid sphere, adding
that the greater the size of the same the greater the difficulty
there is in moving it, and that the larger the globe the more
difficult it is to take in at a glance any considerable part of
the map.&nbsp;While making no specific mention of any of the
globe makers of the time, his reference to the subject seems to
assure us that globes were objects more or less familiar to
students of geography in his day.</p>

<p>Fiorini cites at some length an inventory relating to the
printing establishment of Alexander Rosselli of Florence, under
whose father, Francesco, this establishment became
famous.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> The father died in the year 1510, but it is
probable that this artist, painter, and miniaturist, who issued
for his establishment numerous maps, printed, likewise, globe
gores. While the inventory gives us intimation of his great
activity, we have no further knowledge of his work as a globe
maker than is contained therein. It may well have been that the
construction of globes with printed gore maps had its origin in
Florence in the very early sixteenth century, and that a credit
we have been accustomed to give to German map makers<a name=
"FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> is in reality due the
Rosselli family of Italy, particularly Francesco Rosselli.</p>

<p>Fiorini likewise alludes to a letter written by Friar Zenobio
Acciaioli, dated Lucca, May 12, 1509, and addressed to the
Florentine, Luigi Pietro Guicciardini, brother <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>of the
distinguished historian.<a name="FNanchor_136" id=
"FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class=
"fnanchor">136</a> Request is made in this letter that
assistance and advice be given to a brother monk, Barnaba Canti,
who had been asked to describe a map on which the newly
discovered lands were well drawn, there being written on the map
the history of the islands, with a description of the lands and
of the customs of the peoples. Attention is likewise called to a
globe which Canti possessed, it being designated as &#8220;sphaerula&#8221;
or small. The letter further notes, &#8220;Cupit autem illam Joannes
teutonicus astrologus, ut ex suis ad me literis quas inclusas
tibi in his mitto, videre poteris.&#8221; &#8220;John the German astronomer
desires this (map?) as you will be able to see from his letters
to me which enclosed I send to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is ingeniously argued that the Joannes referred to was none
other than John Sch&ouml;ner, who later became famous as
mathematician and as map and globe maker, and that the globe
referred to by Acciaioli was one in the construction of which the
globe gores of Rosselli had been used, since &#8220;Joannes teutonicus&#8221;
in all probability would not have thought of receiving from Italy
a manuscript globe.</p>

<p>For the history of globe making as practiced in Florence in
these early years, there is in the record of the deliberations of
the Florentine Signoria, dated December 30, 1515, an entry of
interest.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> The Priors and Gonfaloniers directed
attention to the sphere, which had been placed in the orologia or
clock room, noting that the terrestrial orb which had been
painted thereon was greatly damaged, &#8220;... super qua depicta est
figura et situs orbis terrarum ... devastata et male picta.&#8221; They
expressed a desire that it should be fully repaired and be made
suitable as an adornment of the wonderful clock, and in keeping
with the remarkable celestial sphere which was placed near by:
&#8220;ut similis sit et non discrepet, in sua qualitate, a mirabili
orologio predicto, et a convicina et mirabili palla, ubi apparet
figura et ambitus celi.&#8221; Having knowledge of the ability and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">
66</a></span>skill of Friar Giuliano Vannelli, it was decided to
entrust the reconstruction to him. We learn that on June 28,
1516, the Signoria directed payment of fifty large florins be
made to Friar Giuliano, in addition to the six already paid, for
the painted sphere; that on July 17, 1516, the officers of the
Monte Comune directed the payment of fifty-six large gold florins
to &#8220;Don Giuliani Vanegli&#8221; &#8220;in appreciation of his work, and as a
reward for having made one of the two balls of the clock, which
is in the large room of the Signoria, which ball he both designed
and painted, showing on it the entire universe, according to
Ptolemy and other authors who deal with the subject.&#8221; Fiorini
notes that as at this time the terrestrial sphere was damaged it
probably was several years old, and that if badly painted (male
picta) the inference is, it failed to record the latest
discoveries. If the exact date of the construction of the spheres
which adorn this clock cannot be ascertained, it was at least
before 1500.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>We have further evidence of Vannelli&#8217;s interest in globe
construction contained in a letter dated Rome, November, 1524,
and addressed to Cardinal Giovanni Salviati, a legate of
Lombardy. &#8220;Your Excellency has asked me to make for you a small
ball <i>de situ orbis</i>, of the size and character of that of
Giovanni Ruccellai.... I have made the said ball, and have
varnished it, but the weather being bad it will not be dry for
eight or ten days.... Your Excellency also tells me that you
would like to have a large globe similar to that of Mons. R.
Rodulphis, which I have begun. If you desire that I should go on
with the work, I shall willingly do so, putting aside all other
work to serve you.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>To the interest in globe making north of the Alps in the first
quarter of the sixteenth century attention may next be directed.
In a letter written by Johannes Trithemius to Vuilhelmus Veldicus
Monapius, dated August 12, 1507, may be found an early allusion
to globes. He says: &#8220;Orbem terrae marisqui et insularum quem
pulchre depictum in Vuormotia scribis esse venalem, me quidem
consequi posse <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id=
"Page_67">67</a></span>obtarum, sed quadraginta pro illo
expendere florenos, nemo mihi facile persuadet. Comparavi autem
mihi, ante paucos dies, pro aere modico sphaeram orbis pulchram
in quantitate parva ...&#8221; &#8220;I wanted to buy a finely painted globe
of the earth, seas, and islands, which I wrote was for sale in
Worms, but I could hardly be induced to give such a price for it
as forty florins. I purchased, however, a few days since at a low
price, a beautiful terrestrial globe of small size.&#8221;<a name=
"FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> He wrote further,
&#8220;Henricum de Bunau dies vita audini defunctum, sed libros eius et
globum cosmographiae quem alim comparavit ex officina tua
remanisse apud Saxoniae Principes, quod tu existimas non audini.&#8221;
&#8220;I am informed that Henry Bunau died some time ago, but I never
heard it said that his books and the cosmographical globe which
he bought in your work-shop remained with the Princes of Saxony,
as you believe.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_141" id=
"FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class=
"fnanchor">141</a> It has been thought by some that the globe
referred to as having been purchased in Worms was the globe of
Waldseem&uuml;ller.</p>

<p>Since the discovery in 1902 of the long-lost
Waldseem&uuml;ller maps of 1507 and of 1516 by Professor Joseph
Fischer, S.J., in the library of Prince de Waldburg-Wolfegg (Fig.
<a href="#f30">30</a>), great interest has centered especially in the work of that
early German map maker. As the new transatlantic discoveries of
the Spanish and the Portuguese greatly quickened interest in
geographical science and made necessary the construction of new
maps in rapid succession, Germany, already a land in which the
renaissance spirit had found an enthusiastic reception, and whose
people were awake to every new interest, soon became a center for
the spread of information concerning the new regions.
Commercially important trade cities of this country had been for
some time in intimate touch with the important maritime trade
centers of Spain and Portugal. Word of the newest discoveries was
quickly carried over the Alps to France and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>to
Germany, and the latest publication of the writer on matters
geographical had its references to the parts of the world newly
found of which Ptolemy had not known.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;30. Castle of Prince Waldburg de Wolfegg.</p></div>

<p>One of the first German geographers of the century, and now
justly famed as one of the most distinguished of the period, was
Martin Waldseem&uuml;ller (ca. 1470-1522 ca.), whose name,
according to the practice of the time, was classicized as
Hylacomylus.<a name="FNanchor_142" id=
"FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class=
"fnanchor">142</a> So significant was the influence of
Waldseem&uuml;ller in the mapping of the New World that a
somewhat detailed word concerning him may here well be given.
When Duke Ren&eacute; of Lorraine (1451-1508) became a patron of
learning, with particular interest in cosmography or geography,
the cartographical studies of the Germans began to have a place
of far-reaching importance. It was under this enlightened duke
that the little town of St. Di&eacute; became a center of
culture. Here was organized the Vosgian Gymnasium,<a name=
"FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> a society of
learned men not unlike the Platonic Academy of Florence or the
Danubian Society, Vienna. Of this St. Di&eacute; coterie none was
more prominent than Jean Bassin de Sandacourt,<a name=
"FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> the translator of
the &#8216;Four Voyages&#8217; of Amerigo Vespucci from the French into the
Latin, Lud, the ducal secretary and author of an important little

Ringmann, planned and carried well on toward completion, as early

from the Greek into the Latin, and that thought perhaps had its
inspiration in the letters of Vespucci, in which he gave an
account of his four voyages, and in the new chart which but
recently had fallen into the hands of Ringmann. These charts,
says Lud, in his &#8216;Speculum,&#8217; came from Portugal, which, if true,
leads one to the belief that <span class="pagenum"><a name=

great interest centers in these &#8220;new maps,&#8221; prepared for the

the map to which Waldseem&uuml;ller repeatedly alludes in the

(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f31">31</a>), which map it was the good fortune of Professor Joseph

<p>From the above citation it appears that as early as April,
1507, the same preparation had been made for a globe that had
been made for the issue of a large world map.&nbsp;The map, as
noted, has been found, but neither a globe nor a set of globe
gores is known bearing the indisputable evidence of his
authorship.&nbsp;In the library of Prince Liechtenstein, however,
is a somewhat crudely executed gore map (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f32">32</a>) which,
according to certain cartographical students, should be accepted
as a copy of the work to which the allusions are made in the
&#8216;Cosmographiae.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_154" id=

of the globe ball which the gores could be made to cover, were
printed from a wood engraved block. They exhibit the Old World,
in the main, in accord with the Ptolemaic idea, and the New World

<p>That which adds special significance to this young German&#8217;s
representations of the new lands, so far as our study of globes
is concerned, is the repeated recurrence of his <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>particular outlines or contours in the globe maps
of the first quarter of the century, produced by such
cartographers as Johann Sch&ouml;ner of N&uuml;rnberg, and by
those of his school, as will be noted below. Both the globe and
the large world map were doubtless printed in large numbers and
widely distributed. Waldseem&uuml;ller states in a legend on his
marine chart of 1516 that he had printed his map of 1507 in one
thousand copies,<a name="FNanchor_157" id=
"FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class=
"fnanchor">157</a> but one of which is now known.</p>

<p>In a little tract, printed in Strassburg in the year 1509,
there appears to be a reference to a globe which may be that
constructed by Waldseem&uuml;ller. It is this reference which the
Prince of Liechtenstein, as noted above, has taken as a reference
to the gore map, a copy of which is in his collection. The title
of this tract reads, &#8220;Diss b&uuml;chlin saget wie die zw&#275;

<p>In the same year, 1509, there issued from the press of
Gr&uuml;niger a second volume, in character somewhat like the
preceding, but in the Latin language. In this the allusion to the
globe is more definite, for its title seems to assure us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">
72</a></span>that it was prepared to accompany a real globe.
This title reads, &#8220;Globus mundi Declaratio siue descriptio mundi

<p>There is still a third volume printed by Gr&uuml;niger in this
year, 1509, which, however, appears to be but little more than a
German translation of the &#8216;Globus Mundi.&#8217; The title, slightly
altered, reads, &#8220;Der welt kugel Beschryb&#363;ng der Welt und dess

of the appearance of the globe from the small woodcut printed on
the title-page of both the Latin and the German editions, of
which a conspicuous feature is the representation of a small land
area southwest of Africa, bearing the inscription &#8220;N&uuml;w welt&#8221;

<p>The Lenox globe<a name="FNanchor_163" id=
"FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class=
"fnanchor">163</a> is often referred to as the oldest extant
post-Columbian globe. It is an engraved copper ball of excellent
workmanship, 127 mm. in diameter (Figs. <a href="#f34">34</a>, <a href="#f35">35</a>), neither signed
nor dated, and is without mountings. A critical study of its
geographical records, particularly of the New World
representations, has led to the conclusion that it was made as
early as 1510. The two sections or hemispheres of which it is
composed are joined at the equator. Neither parallels nor
meridians are indicated, and though a striking error appears in
giving to the eastern hemisphere, or the Old World, too great an
extension in longitude, the principal latitudes are well given.
The globe was found in the year 1850, in Paris, by Mr. Richard
Hunt, by whom it was presented to Mr. James Lenox, and is now one
of the choicest objects in that great collector&#8217;s library, which
library constitutes an important part of the New
York <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">
74</a></span>Public Library. In its New World representation, South
America appears as a large island having three regional names,
&#8220;Mundus Novus,&#8221; &#8220;Terra Sanctae Crucis,&#8221; and &#8220;Terra de Brazil.&#8221;
&#8220;Isabel&#8221; (Cuba), &#8220;Spagnolla&#8221; (Haiti), and a few unnamed islands
belonging to the West Indies have been outlined. In the place of
North America there are scattered islands, one of which, located
near the northwest extremity of &#8220;Terra de Brazil,&#8221; bears the name
&#8220;Zipangri&#8221; (Japan), and one in the far north, but unnamed,
clearly resembles the Cortereal region, as it appears on the
Cantino and on the Canerio map.&nbsp;A few of the many islands in
the eastern seas are designated by name as &#8220;Taprobana,&#8221;
&#8220;Madagascar,&#8221; and &#8220;Seilan.&#8221;</p>

<p>A globe but little known, but resembling in a striking manner
the Lenox, is that belonging to the Jagellonicus University
Library of Cracow, Poland.<a name="FNanchor_164" id=
"FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class=
"fnanchor">164</a> It is a gilded copper ball, 7.3 cm. in
diameter (Figs. <a href="#f37">36</a>, <a href="#f37">37</a>), and constitutes a part of a fine old
clock of the sixteenth century. Meridians and parallels are
engraved and numbered on its surface at intervals of ten degrees,
the prime meridian passing through the island Ferro. While it is
neither signed nor dated, there is scarcely a doubt that it is as
old as the Lenox globe; indeed, the geographical features of the
two globes are so similar that they appear to be the work of the
same globe maker, or copies of a common original, yet it is
noteworthy that the nomenclature of the Jagellonicus globe is
somewhat richer. The large island which lies southeast of
Madagascar and is nameless on the Lenox appears on the
Jagellonicus with a very interesting inscription, reading
&#8220;America noviter reperta.&#8221; Comparing the coast of &#8220;Mundus Novus&#8221;
with the coast of this &#8220;America noviter reperta,&#8221; Tadeus
Estreicher finds support for the belief that the globe was
constructed soon after the year 1507, in which year
Waldseem&uuml;ller suggested the name America for the region
discovered by Amerigo Vespucci. He, however, seems
not to have noticed the possibility that the inscription
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>appearing on this large island indicated not only an
acquaintance, on the part of the Jagellonicus cartographer, with
Waldseem&uuml;ller&#8217;s suggestion as to the name America, but a
belief that America was actually located in this particular
region. In his chapter on climates Waldseem&uuml;ller says,
&#8220;Atq&#541; in sexto climate Antarctic&ugrave; versus &amp; pars
extrema Africae nuper reperta &amp; Zamzibar Iauva minor &amp;
Seula insule &amp; quarta orbis pars (quam quia Americus inveuit
Amerigen quasi Americi terr&#257; siue Americ&#257; nuncupare licet)
sitae sunt.&#8221; &#8220;In the sixth climate toward the Antarctic there are
situated the farthest part of Africa, recently discovered, the
islands Zanzibar, the lesser Java, and Seula, and the fourth part
of the earth, which, because Amerigo discovered it, we may call
Amerige, the land of Amerigo, so to speak, or America.&#8221;<a name=
"FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> Following the
above, Waldseem&uuml;ller notes what Pomponius Mela has to say
concerning &#8220;these southern climates,&#8221; that is, concerning this
antipodal region.</p>

<p>In the rich cartographical collection of Prince Liechtenstein
there may be found, in addition to the globe gores referred to
above, an interesting globe, usually referred to as the mounted
Hauslab globe.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> It is of wood,
having a diameter of about 37
cm. and is covered with a preparation on which a world map has
been drawn or painted. It is furnished with a wooden base, a
meridian and a horizon circle of brass, and an axis of iron on
which it turns, all of which furnishings, however, appear to be
of later date than the sphere itself. Though neither signed nor
dated, it exhibits many features which suggest a close
relationship with the globes of Johann Sch&ouml;ner; indeed, it
is not improbable that it is an early example of his workmanship.
&#8220;I am of the opinion,&#8221; says Luksch, &#8220;that the globe of
Sch&ouml;ner of 1515 and the Hauslab globe were drawn from one
common original sketch,&#8221; a conclusion based largely upon the fact
that on the two globes the outlines of the
New World are almost identical. As to the date when constructed, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
comparison with other globes of the second decade of the century
has led to the conclusion that it must have been prior to the
year 1515, and perhaps as early as 1513. In its representation of
the Old World, the land is made to extend through 240 degrees,
counting from the island of Porto Santo, whose meridian has been
taken as the prime meridian. The northern section of the New
World is given the name &#8220;Par(ias),&#8221; the last letters of the word
having been obliterated by age, while the southern section is
called &#8220;America.&#8221; The great austral land south of the apex of the
southern continent, appearing on the Sch&ouml;ner globe of 1515
as &#8220;Brasilie regio,&#8221; is omitted on the Hauslab globe. The
continents, rivers, and mountains represented are very dark in
color, and were probably originally blue, black, or red, and the
seas are a dark blue. The equator, as drawn on the surface of the
sphere, is divided into degrees, represented alternately in white
and black, and every tenth degree is indicated by an appropriate
number, beginning, as stated above, at the island of Porto Santo.
By way of decoration a border of gold is given to the lines
representing the equator, the tropics, and the polar circles.</p>

<p>In the geographical department of the Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale of Paris is a globe referred to in cartographical
literature as the Green globe, or the Quirini globe, the first
name being given to it by Gabriel Marcel,<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167">
</a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> by reason of the
prominence of the color green employed in painting the seas (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f38">38</a>).
It is an unsigned and undated wooden sphere, 24 cm. in
diameter. Its surface appears to have been covered with a coating
of paint, originally white, and on this the world map was drawn.
There is much artistic skill displayed in the coast
configurations, with the deeply shaded seaboards making the land
appear to rise above the ocean surface, and in the representation
of the islands, most of which are made conspicuous in red or
gold. The inscriptions in dark brown, perhaps originally black,
are neatly written, clearly suggesting that the globe was
constructed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id=
"Page_77">77</a></span>in the first quarter of the sixteenth
century, perhaps as early as 1513 or 1515. The equator, the
tropics, and the polar circles are traced in gold; the degrees of
latitude and longitude are marked in red, and at intervals of ten
degrees. The prime meridian is made to pass through the Cape
Verde Islands, islands referred to as &#8220;Insule Portugalensium
invente anno Domini 1472.&#8221; This globe shows a striking
resemblance to those of Sch&ouml;ner of 1515, a fact which has
led Marcel to refer it to the Sch&ouml;nerian school, though not
to attribute it directly to Sch&ouml;ner himself. A very
important and interesting feature of the globe is the appearance
of the name &#8220;America&#8221; no less than four times in the New World;
twice in what we now call North America and twice in South
America. It is, indeed, the oldest known cartographical monument
on which the name America is given both to the north and the
south continental areas. In the southern continent we read
&#8220;America ab inuentore nuncupata,&#8221; and near the Antilles &#8220;Iste
insule per Columbus genuensem almirantem et mandato regis
castelle invente sunt.&#8221; &#8220;These islands were discovered by
Columbus, a Genoese admiral, by command of the king of Castile.&#8221;
Harrisse observes that it appears the cartographer thought of

da Vinci, but with very little more reason for the assignment
than the fact that they were found in a collection of papers in
the handwriting of that famous artist. They are drawn as
equilateral triangles, each representing one eighth of the
earth&#8217;s surface, not as biangles, which is the usual form for
early globe gores.<a name="FNanchor_172" id=

1507.<a name="FNanchor_174" id=

South America, a large island, has conspicuously inscribed the

gores are chiefly of interest by reason of their peculiar
form.</p>

<p>An interesting set of globe gores of the first quarter of the
sixteenth century is that attributed to Boulengier, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">

across the bottom of the map reads, &#8220;Vniversalis cosmographie

of Waldseem&uuml;ller&#8217;s &#8216;Cosmographiae Introductio,&#8217; printed at
Lyons by Jean de la Place, but undated. Harrisse gives as the

MDXIV,&#8221; and signed &#8220;Artificis Ludovici Boulengier, Allebie,
1514.&#8221; As this edition of the &#8216;Cosmographiae&#8217; was prepared for
the press by Boulengier,<a name="FNanchor_177" id=
"FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class=
"fnanchor">177</a> who in his day achieved distinction as a
mathematician, astronomer, and geographer, this gore map has been
ascribed to him. It appears from a statement on the verso of a
folded plate belonging to Chapter VIII that a globe had been
prepared to accompany it.<a name="FNanchor_178" id=
"FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class=
"fnanchor">178</a> This statement, while not agreeing in all
respects with one to be found in the edition of 1507, is of
similar import. Boulengier states in his dedicatory letter that
he had noted other globes which had been previously published. As
a bit of copper engraving it is very artistically done; its
inscriptions, coast outlines, and rivers are drawn in soft
ornamental lines. That region representing North America bears
simply the name &#8220;Nova,&#8221; while South America is referred to as
&#8220;America noviter reperta,&#8221; a wording for this information which
elsewhere appears only on the Jagellonicus globe. These gores are
of sufficient dimensions to cover a ball 11 cm. in diameter.</p>

<p>In the year 1877 or 1878, reports Professor Ferdinando Jacoli,
Admiral William Acton acquired two interesting and scientifically
valuable terrestrial globes of the early sixteenth <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">
80</a></span>century once belonging to Count Piloni of Belluno,
Italy.<a name="FNanchor_179" id=
"FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class=
"fnanchor">179</a> That one appearing to be the older of the
two resembles so closely the Paris green globe in size, having a
diameter of 24 cm., and in its details, that there is good reason
for thinking it to be the work of the same author. Like the Paris
globe it is neither signed nor dated. The surface of the ball is
covered with a preparation of plaster on which the geographical
details have been written. Seas and lands are colored, the
equator, the tropics, and the polar circles are indicated by
gilded lines. Meridians are drawn at intervals of ten degrees,
the prime meridian passing through the Canary Islands, and
parallels are likewise represented at intervals of ten degrees.
The metal meridian circle and the stand upon which the sphere
rests retain in places some of the old gilding. Professor Jacoli
expresses the opinion that it may be of Spanish or of Portuguese
origin, an opinion based upon the nomenclature. It seems,
however, probable that the author was an Italian and that he
merely employed the Spanish or the Portuguese sources, as was so
frequent, and in so large a measure necessary, in that day. In
Africa the author has represented the &#8220;Peludes nili,&#8221; and two
lakes into which several rivers flow having their source in the
Mountains of the Moon. To the south-east of the continent is
represented &#8220;Zanzibar insula,&#8221; and near this are a number of
small islands with the legend &#8220;Iste insule ex mandato regis
Portugalliae lustrate sunt.&#8221; The islands of Ceylon and Sumatra
are laid down but are given the names &#8220;Taprobana&#8221; and &#8220;Seula&#8221;
respectively. In the interior of Asia we read &#8220;Carama civitas
magna,&#8221; near this &#8220;Thebet provincia mais,&#8221; and below &#8220;Hic
d&ntilde;at prespiter Johannes rex totius Indiae.&#8221; In eastern
Asia is the name &#8220;Catay&#8221; and near this the legend &#8220;Zumsay est
qued&atilde; civitas mag. in medio lacus magnus,&#8221; the Paris globe
having &#8220;Quinsay&#8221; instead of &#8220;Zumsay.&#8221; The New World in its
outlines bears striking resemblance to the early globes of
Sch&ouml;ner. Along the west coast of South America is the legend
&#8220;Tota ista provincia inventa est per mandatum regis <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">
81</a></span>Castelle,&#8221; near the same &#8220;Terra ultra incognita,&#8221;
and extending along the west coast of North America &#8220;Terra
ulterius incognita,&#8221; all of which legends, in identical wording,
appear on the Paris globe. The Antilles are referred to in the
legend &#8220;iste insule per Columbum Genuensem Almirantem ex mandato
regis Castelle perite sunt,&#8221; and in South America &#8220;America ab
inventore nuncupata.&#8221; Near the west coast of Africa we find
&#8220;Insule portugalensium invente&mdash;domini 1477,&#8221; one of which
is called &#8220;visionis insula.&#8221; The author has also represented an
Antarctic continent but has made no reference to it by specific
name or legend. If the Paris globe was constructed before 1520,
as Marcel concluded, there is likewise good reason why the Acton
globe should also be assigned to the second decade of the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Las Casas, in his &#8216;Historia de las Indias,&#8217; tells us that when
Magellan (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f41">41</a>) offered his services to the King of Spain for
an expedition to the Moluccas he had a globe to serve him in the
demonstration of his plan. &#8220;Tra&igrave;a el Magallanes vn Globo
bien pintado, en que toda la tierra estaba, y alli
se&ntilde;al&ograve; el camino que habia de llevar, salvo que el

"FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class=
"fnanchor">180</a> &#8220;Magellan had a well painted globe, which
exhibited the entire earth, and he showed thereby the route which
he thought of taking, but with intention he had left the strait
blank so that no one might learn his secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>Other allusions to this globe we do not have, unless there is
such in a letter written by Sebastian Alvares to King Don Manuel,
dated Seville, July 18, 1519. In giving information concerning
the plan of Magellan Alvares states: &#8220;A rrota que se diz que han

said they are to take is straight to Cape Frio, Brazil remaining
on their right hand until they reach the line of demarcation,
thence they are to navigate to the west and west-northwest
straight to Moluco, which land of Moluco I have seen laid down on
the sphere and map which the son of Reynell made here which was
not complete when his father came here for him; and his father
finished it all, and placed these islands of Moluco; and after
this pattern all the maps are made which Diego Ribeiro makes, and
he makes the compasses, quadrants and globes, but he does not go
in the fleet, nor does he wish to do more than gain his living by
his skill.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_181" id=
"FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class=
"fnanchor">181</a></p>

<p>We find reference to a globe of this early period as belonging
to Juan Sebastian del Cano, the reference thereto being contained
in his will made on board the Victoria, June 26, 1526, and
reading &#8220;Una esfera poma del mondo.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_182"
id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class=
"fnanchor">182</a> It probably was made of wood and painted, as
there is good reason for believing that such as were carried by
early navigators on their vessels were of this character.
Harrisse thinks &#8220;this globe would probably prove to be one of the
most interesting of all for that period, exhibiting, doubtless,
the hypothesis of Magellan relative to the configuration of the
southwest coast of South America north of 50 degrees south
latitude.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_183" id=
"FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class=
"fnanchor">183</a> Although the will of Del Cano is dated 1526
there is reason for thinking the globe was constructed prior to
1520.</p>

<p>Among the globe makers of the early sixteenth century none
merits greater distinction than Johann Sch&ouml;ner of
N&uuml;rnberg (1477-1547) (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f42">42</a>), mathematician, astronomer,
and geographer.<a name="FNanchor_184" id=
"FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class=
"fnanchor">184</a> He was born in Carlstadt, Franconia, held a
church office for some years in Bamberg, and in the year 1526,
upon the advice of Melanchthon, became a professor of mathematics
in the gymnasium of N&uuml;rnberg, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>to the fame of which
city, as a scientific center, Regiomontanus had so greatly
contributed in the preceding century. His activities as a globe
maker began as early as the second decade of the century, and his
influence soon became very pronounced. In N&uuml;rnberg he
labored until the time of his death in the year 1547, editing, in
addition to his other activities, the literary and scientific
works of Regiomontanus and of Werner, and each year until 1543
issued his so-called Calendars. His numerous publications,
mathematical, astronomical, and cosmographical, alone entitle him
to a place of first importance among German scientific leaders of
his day.</p>

<p>It was as early as 1515, at the cost of a wealthy patron,
Johann Seylor, that he made in Bamberg what has usually been
accepted as his first globe, two copies of which are now known,
and for which it has been thought he wrote his tract bearing
title &#8216;Luculentissima quaed&#257; terrae totius descriptio ... cum
privilegio Invictis Romanor&ucirc; Impera Maximiliani per acto
annos: ne quis imprimat: aut imprimere procuret codices has: cum
globis cosmographicis: Noribergae 1515.&#8217; &#8216;A most luminous
description of the whole earth ... with the privilege of the
Invincible Emperor of the Romans, Maximilian, for eight years to
the effect that nobody shall print or have any of these books
printed, with the cosmographic globe.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_185"

"fnanchor">185</a> On the leaf preceding &#8220;fol. 1&#8221; is the
representation of a mounted globe.</p>

<p>One of Sch&ouml;ner&#8217;s globes of 1515 is to be found in the
Grand Ducal Library of Weimar, and one in the City Museum of
Frankfurt (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f43">43</a>). Wieser,<a name="FNanchor_186" id=
"FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class=
"fnanchor">186</a> after a careful comparison, finds these
globes to be practically alike in all details. Each is 27 cm. in
diameter, having the usual mountings of brass, the whole resting
on a wooden base. While neither signed nor dated, they answer the
description contained in Sch&ouml;ner&#8217;s little tract referred to
above. That region on the globe which we may designate North
America, he calls &#8220;Parias&#8221;; the South American continent bears
the name <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">
85</a></span>&#8220;America&#8221; and the austral land the name &#8220;Brasilie
regio.&#8221; In addition to these principal regions he has represented
the land discovered by the Cortereals, designating the same as
&#8220;Litus incognitum.&#8221; Cuba bears the name &#8220;Isabella&#8221; and Haiti the
name &#8220;Spagnolla.&#8221; The feature which seems to give special
interest to these globes of Sch&ouml;ner is the representation of
a strait between &#8220;America&#8221; and &#8220;Brasilie regio.&#8221; To the
significance of this particular representation Wieser has given
very careful consideration. He cites numerous passages from the
tract of Sch&ouml;ner, and from the &#8216;Copia der newen Zeitung aus
Presillig Landt,&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_187" id=
"FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class=
"fnanchor">187</a> a publication which he finds good reason
for believing appeared before 1515, and in which he finds an
acceptable explanation of the origin of this geographical notion
represented by Sch&ouml;ner, which antedates the Magellan
expedition by a period of five years.</p>

<p>It is a point to be especially noted that the dominant
cosmographical idea of the map makers of the first quarter of the
century represented the New World regions as independent of Asia.
It is the idea set forth in the Portuguese maps, such as the
Cantino and the Canerio; it is the idea which we find represented
in the Waldseem&uuml;ller maps and practically in all the
Lusitano-Germanic maps of the period.<a name="FNanchor_188"

in the opinion of the author, scarcely the slightest ground for
accepting the conclusions of Henry Stevens and Professor v.
Wieser, that the globe gores, now in the possession of the New
York Public Library (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f44a">44a</a>), and described by them as the
lost globe of Sch&ouml;ner of 1523, are of Sch&ouml;nerian

convincing to set this question at rest.<a name=

concludes his little tract in the following words: &#8220;Ego tam
mirifice orbis pervagationi nonnihil volens adiicere, ut quae
lectu videantur mirabilia, aspectu credantur prohabiliora, Globum
hunc in orbis modum effingere studui, exemplar haud fallibile

volens, quipp&#275; qui es tempor&egrave;, quantum phas erat
homini abdita mundi penetrare, abunde expressit, modo sese

aggressus sum. Cognoscam profecto meas lucubratiunculas tuae
celsitudini nullatenus despectui fore. Vale.&#8221; &#8220;Being desirous of
making some small addition to this wonderful survey of the earth,
so that what appears very extraordinary to the reader may appear
more likely, when thus illustrated, I have been at the pains to
construct this globe, having copied a very accurate one which an
ingenious Spaniard has sent to a person of distinction. I do not
however wish to set aside the globe I constructed some time
since, as it fully showed all that had, at that time, been
discovered: so that the former, as far as it goes, agrees with
the latter. Please then to accept this globe in the same friendly
spirit in which I undertook to construct it for your
gratification. But I am sure you will not despise my humble
attempt. Farewell.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_196" id=

constructed a globe at the time of issuing his tract, and it
gives us a fairly definite idea of its New World
configurations, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">

earlier globes. It seems probable, however, that in some manner
he indicated an Asiatic connection of the new lands, an idea
which is so frequently expressed in the maps of the next quarter
of a century, especially in the globe maps, an idea not to be
finally set at rest until the discovery of Bering put an end to
the controversy.</p>

<p>How Sch&ouml;ner, and others, came to the conclusion that
&#8220;Parias&#8221; (North America) is not &#8220;a large independent portion of
the earth in that fourth part of the world,&#8221; but has an Asiatic
connection, and how they set down that conclusion in their maps
will receive consideration in the following chapter.</p>

<p>Though not a maker of globes, in so far as we have definite
knowledge, Albrecht D&uuml;rer turned his attention to the
drafting of maps, two of which have for us here a certain
interest. In the year 1515 Johannes Stabius designed a map of the
Old World on a stereographic projection (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f45">45</a>), one of the
first of its kind, which D&uuml;rer is said to have engraved.
While the map itself is of little importance it is of interest as
an attempt to represent in perspective a spherical earth.<a name=

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;45. Stabius World Globe Map, 1515.</p></div>

<p>D&uuml;rer likewise undertook the drafting and engraving of a
celestial map (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f46">46</a>), than which of this character there
appears to be none earlier known. It was not so drawn as to make
possible its application to the surface of a sphere, but its
reshaping for that purpose could not have been for him a
difficult proposition. He, with others of this time, was giving
thought to the problem of globe-gore construction.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><b>S</b> in the first quarter of the sixteenth century, so in the
second we find engraved brass and copper globes, globes with
manuscript maps, and those with printed or engraved gore
maps. Since the latter in this period have especially found
favor, attention is more and more directed toward the
shaping of the segments or gores with that mathematical
nicety which, as previously stated, would admit of a perfect
or almost perfect adjustment when they were applied to the
surface of a prepared ball.</p>

<p>To the independent position of the New World as represented
on the globe maps prior to 1525 attention has been called in
the preceding chapter, but the idea of such independence, it
may here be noted, is one contrary to that very generally
though erroneously entertained by historians who have
written of the period, an error doubtless in large measure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>due to a failure on their part to give proper heed to the
record of the maps as expressing the geographical notions
commonly accepted. Harrisse has well stated the case in
referring to the geographical opinions of the earliest
explorers, observing that the moment search began for a
waterway leading from Oceanus Occidentalis to Oceanus
Orientalis, that moment opinion began to become conviction
that a new continental region had been found, that a New
World had been discovered,<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> and practically all of the
early explorers had hope of finding such a waterway. It is
very true that more than two hundred years passed from
Columbus&#8217; day before there was positive proof of an
independence of the newly found land, but the earliest map
makers outlined it as if believing in its independence of an
Old World or Asiatic connection.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> The so-called
Bartholomew Columbus sketch maps,<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200"
class="fnanchor">200</a> probably drawn in the first decade of
the sixteenth century (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f47">47</a>), alone can be cited,
among the maps of any particular importance in the first
quarter of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>this century, as distinctly indicating a
belief in an Asiatic connection. Attention was likewise
called in the preceding chapter to the fact that toward the
close of the century&#8217;s first quarter the idea that a
veritably independent new continent had been found was
beginning to be doubted.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> This doubt seemed to follow
close upon the publication of the report of Magellan&#8217;s
expedition.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> It indeed appears to be generally accepted
that to the report of that remarkable circumnavigation, to
the letters of Cortes respecting his Mexican expedition,<a
name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> and to the failure of
his and of other Spanish attempts to find a strait north of
the equator through which one might pass from Oceanus
Occidentalis to Oceanus Orientalis,<a name="FNanchor_204"
id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> the changed conception of the
geography of the New World was due.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;47. Bartholomew Columbus Sketch Map, 1506.</p></div>

<p>This changed conception seems to have found first
expression, on a map, in a little volume prepared by
Franciscus Monachus, a friar of Mechlin, about 1525. The
title of this volume reads in part,<a name="FNanchor_205"
id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> &#8216;De orbis situ ac descriptione. ad
Reuerendiss. D. archiepiscopum Panormitanum, Francisci,
Monachi ordinis Franciscani, epistola sane qu&atilde;
luculenta ...&#8217; &#8216;A very excellent letter from Franciscus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>a monk of the Franciscan Order, to the Most Reverend
Archbishop of Palermo, touching the site and description of
the world,&#8217; with a colophon reading &#8220;Excudebat Martinus
Caesar, expensis honesti viri Rolandi Bollaert ...&#8221;
&#8220;Martinus Caesar prepared this at the expense of the upright
man Roland Bollert.&#8221; Its two small woodcut maps representing
the world in hemispheres, respectively the Old and the New
World (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f48">48</a>), are of striking historical interest,
while the text contains many references which are of
importance for the light they cast upon the geographical
opinions of the time respecting the New World. Here, as
noted, the New World is first represented on a map as having
distinctly an Asiatic connection, the southern continent
(South America) being separated from the northern only by
that narrow strait which we find so prominently represented
on the Maiollo map of 1527, and there called &#8220;stretto
dubitoso.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> While these hemispheres cannot themselves be
referred to as a globe, they may serve to give us a general
idea of the geographical representations on the globe,
which, as appears probable, was at that time constructed by
the author of the text. To the Ecclesiastical Prince, to
whom Franciscus dedicated his little volume, information was
sent concerning his globe on which he had drawn by hand a
map of the world as he said, the reply to his letter
containing the following statement, &#8220;Orbis globum, in quo
terrae ac maria luculenter depicta sunt, una cum epistola
accepimus.&#8221; &#8220;We accept the globe of the world on which the
land and the seas are elegantly depicted, together with the
epistle.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> Being a gift it would seem reasonable to
conclude that the globe was not duplicated and offered for
sale and that the example referred to was therefore probably
unique. The text of the &#8216;De orbis situ ...,&#8217; as it appears,
was printed because it was thought there was much contained
therein that was new and not in harmony with geographical
ideas hitherto expressed. The first edition was undated, nor
was the second dated, but it agreed in practically all
particulars with the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>first excepting a slight alteration
in the title. A third edition was issued in the year 1565,
and is still known in many copies, of which Gallois gives an
excellent reprint in his biography of Orontius Finius.<a
name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> It is in the first and
second editions that the hemispheres appear; they are
wanting in the third, but as a substitute therefor a small
globe resting on a base appears on the verso of the
title-page, which in its general features may be a
representation of Franciscus&#8217; globe.</p>

<p>Hakluyt, in his &#8216;Discourse on Western Planting,&#8217; alludes to
&#8220;an olde excellent globe in the Queenes privie gallory at
Westminster which also seemeth to be of Verarsanus makinge,
havinge the coste described in Italian, which laieth oute
the very selfe same streite necke of lande in latitude of
40. degrees, with the sea joynninge harde on bothe sides, as
it dothe on Panama and Nombre di Dios; which would be a
matter of singule importannce, yf it shoulde be true, as it
is not unlikely.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> To this particular globe we do not seem
to be able to find any other allusion.</p>

<p>In the geographical department of the Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale there may be found an exceedingly well-executed
globe, neither signed nor dated, but which appears to have
been constructed about the year 1528.<a name="FNanchor_210"
id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> It is an unmounted gilded copper
sphere (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f49">49</a>), having a diameter of about 23 cm. Its
title reads &#8220;Nova et integra universi orbs descriptio,&#8221; &#8220;A
new and complete description of the entire world,&#8221; which,
with all legends and local names, is engraved in small
capitals. Based upon the description we possess of the
Sch&ouml;ner globe of 1523, and upon the close resemblance
of its coast outlines to those of the Weimar globe of 1533,
there is reason for assigning it to the Sch&ouml;nerian
school. It, however, is to be noted that the nomenclature of
the northeast coast of North America is very different from
that which appears on the last-mentioned globe, and that it
more nearly resembles in that region the simple cordiform
map of Orontius Finius of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>year 1536.<a
name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a
href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> The latest
geographical information which it records seems to relate to
the expedition of Verrazano. In the region corresponding to
the present New England, we find the legend &#8220;<span class="smcap">Terra Francesca
nuper Lustrata</span>.&#8221; The Gulf of Mexico is called &#8220;<span class="smcap">Sinus S.
Michaelis</span>,&#8221; and the Caribbean Sea, &#8220;<span class="smcap">Mare Herbidium</span>.&#8221; In
South America are the conspicuous legends &#8220;<span class="smcap">America Inventa
1497</span>,&#8221; &#8220;<span class="smcap">Brazilio Regio</span>,&#8221; and &#8220;<span class="smcap">Terra Nova</span>.&#8221; The great
Antarctic land bears the inscription &#8220;<span class="smcap">Regio Patalis</span>.&#8221; The
Amazon appears as a river of considerable length, with
numerous tributaries. The course of Magellan&#8217;s voyage, so
frequently laid down on the maps of the period, here finds
record in the threadlike line which encircles the globe. As
in the hemispheres of Franciscus, so here, America is laid
down as a part of the Asiatic continent. The workmanship of
the globe is equal to the best that one could find in the
Italy, France or Germany of that day, while the few German
words among the numerous Latin names, as &#8220;Baden,&#8221;
&#8220;Braunschweig,&#8221; and &#8220;Wien,&#8221; give some support for the claim
that it is of German origin. A Spanish origin, as has
sometimes been claimed for it, can hardly be accepted.</p>

<p>Parmentier, a native of the famous seaport Dieppe, had in
his day, as a maker of charts, a very substantial
reputation. Whether one should conclude from references to
him as a cartographer that he busied himself with the
construction of globes cannot be definitely determined, as
these references indicate that his maps were merely
constructed on a projection which enabled him in some
measure to represent the curved surface of the earth.
Schefer, in his work &#8216;Le discours de la navigation de Jean
et Raoul Permentier,&#8217; says, &#8220;Permentier estoit bon
cosmographe et g&eacute;ographe, et par lui ont est&eacute;
composez plusieurs mappes monde en globe et en plat et
plusieurs cartes marines, sur les quelles plusieurs ont
navigu&eacute; seurement.&#8221; &#8220;Parmentier was a good
cosmographer and geographer, and many maps of the world both
in the form of globes and as plane maps were made <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>by him, also numerous
marine charts by means of which many sailed the seas with
safety.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>Vasari gives us information concerning one Francesco Libri,
member of a famous Veronese artist family, who won
distinction as a globe maker in the early sixteenth century,
and who apparently was most active in this field of endeavor
about the year 1530. Although all trace of the globes he is
said to have constructed is lost, Vasari&#8217;s reference is
worthy citation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Among other things,&#8221; says that interesting, if not always
accurate, Italian biographer, &#8220;he constructed a large globe
of wood, being four feet in diameter; this he then covered
externally with a strong glue, so that there should be no
danger of crack or other injury. Now the globe or ball thus
constructed was to serve as a terrestrial globe. Wherefore
when it had been carefully divided and exactly measured
under the direction and in the presence of Fracastro and
Baroldi, both well versed in physics and distinguished as
cosmographers and astrologers, it was afterward to be
painted by Francesco for a Venetian gentleman, Messer Andrea
Navagero, a most learned orator and poet, who intended to
make a present of the same to King Francis of France, to
whom he was about to be sent as ambassador from the
Republic. But scarcely had Navagero arrived in France and
entered on his office, when he died. The work consequently
remained unfinished, which was much to be regretted since,
executed by Francesco, under the guidance and with the
advice and assistance of two men so distinguished as were
Fracastro and Baroldi, it would doubtless have turned out a
very remarkable production. It remained unfinished, however,
as I have said, and what is worse, even that which had been
done received considerable injury, I know not of what kind,
in the absence of Francesco; yet spoiled as it was, the
globe was purchased by Messer Bartolommeo Lonichi who has
never been prevailed upon to give it up, although he has
been frequently <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>much entreated to do so, and offered
large sums of money for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Francesco had made two smaller globes before commencing the
large one; and of these one is now in the possession of
Mazzanti, Archdeacon of the cathedral of Verona; the other
belonging to the Count Raimondo della Torre, and is now the
property of his son, the Count Giovanni Battista, by whom it
is very greatly valued, seeing that this also was
constructed with the assistance and after measurements of
Fracastro, who was a very intimate friend of Count
Raimondo.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<p>As before noted, the exact date when Francesco constructed
his globes is unknown. Vasari, however, informs us, as noted
above, that the large one was constructed for Andrea
Navagero, who wished to present it to the King of France,
and that very shortly after his arrival in France on his
special mission his death occurred, which we know to have
been the eighth of May, 1529. It must therefore have been in
that year that Francesco completed the construction of his
globe. It would be interesting to know the geographical
configuration of the New World as laid down by Fracastro and
Francesco on this large globe, remembering that it was not
long after the mission of Navagero to King Francis that the
first Cartier expedition sailed for the western continent.
We cannot be certain, as stated, of its geographical data,
but it seems probable that it followed the Verrazanian type
as represented, for example, in the Maiollo map of 1527, or
in the Verrazano map of 1529.</p>

<p>The Lorraine Museum of Nancy possesses a fine globe, neither
signed nor dated, but which usually is referred to as the
Nancy globe (Figs. 50, 50a), and is thought to have been
constructed about the year 1530.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214"
class="fnanchor">214</a> It is a silver ball 16 cm. in
diameter, divided on the line of the equator into
hemispheres, and is supported on a small statue of Atlas.
The equator, the tropics, the polar circles, the zodiac, and
one meridian circle passing through the western part of Asia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>in the Old World and through the peninsula of Florida in
the New World, are represented. It is an object of interest
not only for its scientific value in giving us a
geographical record of the period, but it is also of
interest for its fine workmanship, having its land areas
gilded and its seas blue enameled, in which sea monsters and
ships of artistic design appear. We have the record that in
the year 1662, Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, presented it to
the church of N&ocirc;tre Dame de Sion in his residence
city, and that by this church it was long used as a pyx.<a
name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a
href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> There is a
striking resemblance of its land configurations, and of its
geographical nomenclature to that of the Gilt globe, of the
Wooden globe, and of the World map of Orontius Finaeus of
1531. The New World is represented as a part of the Asiatic
continent, and the central section of that region, to which
we may refer as North America, is designated &#8220;Asia
Orientalis&#8221; and &#8220;Asia Major.&#8221; To the east of these names are
numerous regional names, conspicuous among which are &#8220;Terra
Francesca,&#8221; &#8220;Hispania Major,&#8221; and &#8220;Terra Florida.&#8221; The Gulf
of Mexico appears as &#8220;Mare Cathayum.&#8221; Mexico bears the name
&#8220;Hispania Nova,&#8221; while the sea to the west is named &#8220;Mare
Indicum Australe.&#8221; The South American continent is called
&#8220;America Nova,&#8221; and the names are very numerous which have
been given to the various sections, among which we find
&#8220;Terra Firma,&#8221; &#8220;Papagelli,&#8221; &#8220;Terra Canibale,&#8221; &#8220;Parias,&#8221; and
&#8220;Peru Provincia.&#8221; The large austral land bears the name
&#8220;Brasielie Regio,&#8221; which name is placed southeast of Africa,
and the name &#8220;Patalis Regio&#8221; appears southwest of South
America.</p>

<p>Gemma Frisius (1508-1555), a native of Docum (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f51">51</a>),
and for a number of years professor of medicine and
mathematics in the University of Louvain,<a
name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a
href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> issued a little
book, in the year 1530, bearing the title &#8216;De principiis
Astronomiae et Cosmographiae, deque usu globi, ab eodem
editi, item de orbis divisione et insulis, rebusque nuper
inventis ... Antverp, 1530.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> It seems probable that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>was issued to serve as explanatory text for a globe or
globes he had constructed or was preparing to construct. In
it we have one of the earliest technical yet practical
explanations of the parts and uses of the globe, and a
somewhat detailed statement how such instruments may be
serviceably employed in cosmographical studies. On the
title-page there appears the representation of a globe
resting on a base having three feet, which has been thought
to be a representation of his completed work.<a
name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a
href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> We are told in
his &#8216;Epistola salutatoria,&#8217; at least in an implied manner,
that there were to be numerous copies of the globes, seeing
that they were intended for the trade, and Roscelli&#8217;s
statement would lead us to believe that they had found their
way into Italy. All copies, however, appear to have been
lost until a few years since, when both a terrestrial and a
celestial globe of Frisius&#8217; making was found in the
Gymnasium Francisceum of Zerbst, to which discovery a very
considerable interest and importance attaches. In a paper
read before the International Congress of Americanists in
1904, Dr. W. Walter Ruge, all too briefly, describes them,
from which paper the following information is taken.<a

<p>The terrestrial globe, he notes, is not well preserved,
being in certain parts so injured as to render the
inscriptions illegible; but in this fact he, however, finds
a certain compensation, as these injuries are of such
character as to disclose the manner of construction. The
globe ball, he finds, consists of two hemispheres of
papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; 3 mm. in thickness over which is a
layer of plaster 1&frac12; mm. in thickness. On the smooth
surface thus furnished the twelve gores of which the map is
composed had been pasted, these gores extending from pole to
pole.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> Though undated, the following inscription gives
information concerning the map maker and the engravers.
&#8220;Gemma Frisius Medicus ac Mathematicus ex varijs descripsit
geographicorum observationibus, atque in hanc formam
redegit; Gerardus Mercator Rupelmundanus coelavit cum
Caspare a Myrica, cui et <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>sumptibus permaximis et
laboribus nequaquam minoribus opus constat.&#8221; &#8220;Gemma Frisius,
physician and mathematician, made (this globe) from the
various observations of geographers, and fashioned it in
this form. Gerhard Mercator of Rupelmunde with Caspar
Miracus engraved (it) and expended on the work a large sum
and no little labor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frisius appears in this legend as the maker of the map, with
Mercator and Myrica as the engravers. The date of
construction is not given, but it clearly does not belong to
the issue of 1530 referred to above. We read, for example,
along the west coast of South America such names as
&#8220;Tumbes,&#8221; &#8220;tangara siue s. michaelis,&#8221; and &#8220;Turicarami
fluvius,&#8221; and find that this west coast is sketched as far
as latitude 5 degrees south. S. Michaelis was founded in
1532, and information concerning Pizarro&#8217;s discoveries
probably did not reach Europe until 1534. Europe has still
many of the Ptolemaic features, as has also the continent of
Asia. North America, which is rather better drawn than on
any of the earlier maps, has the legend &#8220;Hispania Maior a
Nu&ntilde;o Gusma&ntilde;o devicta anno 1530.&#8221; The west
coast becomes a very indefinite line at latitude 25 degrees
north, at which point we read &#8220;Matonchel siue petra portus.&#8221;
It then sweeps northeastward in a flattened curve to
&#8220;Baccalearum Regio&#8221; with its &#8220;Prom&#333;tori&#363; agricule
seu cabo del labrador.&#8221; From the land around the north pole,
which is connected with Asia, the continent is separated by
a narrow strait which is referred to as &#8220;Fretum arcticum
siue trium fratrum, par quod lusitani in orientem et ad
Indios et Moluccas nauigare conati sunt.&#8221; &#8220;The Arctic strait
or the strait of the three brothers through which the
Portuguese attempted to sail to the East and to the Indies
and the Moluccas.&#8221; No general name is given to South
America, but we find such regional names as &#8220;Nw Peru
Provincia&#8221; and east of this &#8220;Bresilia.&#8221; In the interior are
such legends and local names as &#8220;Caxamalca fuit regis
Atabaliape,&#8221; &#8220;Cuzco,&#8221; &#8220;Cincha,&#8221; &#8220;Collao.&#8221; The nomenclature
shows decided Spanish <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>influence, as we find &#8220;la laguna
poblada,&#8221; &#8220;R. de los esclavos,&#8221; &#8220;R. d. los furmos,&#8221; &#8220;Cabo
corto.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruge further notes the finding in the same Gymnasium of
Zerbst of a celestial globe on which appears the following
legend, &#8220;Faciebant Gemma Frisius medicus ac mathematicus,
Gaspar a Myrica &amp; Gerardus Mercator Rupelmundanus anno a
partu virgineo 1537.&#8221; &#8220;Gemma Frisius physician and
mathematician, Gaspar Myrica and Gerhard Mercator of
Rupelmunde made this globe in the year 1537.&#8221; A comparison
of this legend with that of the terrestrial globe leads to
the somewhat ingenious argument that the latter, though
undated, is the older of the two. We know that Mercator was
a pupil of Gemma Frisius,<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> and that after leaving his
university studies he found employment with the master in
draughting maps and in the construction of mathematical
instruments. In the dated legend of 1537 Mercator and Myrica
appear to have advanced in importance, seeing that in the
undated legend they are merely referred to as the engravers,
while Frisius alone is mentioned as the maker of the
map.&nbsp;Since this discovery we are better informed as to
the source of Mercator&#8217;s information which he gives in his
map of 1538; the evidence being conclusive that in the main
he followed the records of Frisius, adapting his map,
however, to the double cordiform projection.<a name=
"FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></p>

<p>Harrisse describes a gilded copper globe, belonging to the
collection of the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, having a
diameter of 14 cm. and bearing the author and date legend
reading &#8220;Robertus de Bailly 1530.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223"
class="fnanchor">223</a> It is composed of two parts rather
insecurely joined on the line of the equator, and is
entirely without mountings. The engraving of the names, all
in small capitals, has been remarkably well done. In
outlining the contour of the New World the draughtsman of
the map has been influenced by the Verrazanian data, and
although exhibiting minor differences in details there is a
striking resemblance to the map of Maiollo of 1527,<a
name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a
href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> to <span class="pagenum"><a name=

we find such names as &#8220;<span class="smcap">Terra Laboratoris</span>,&#8221; &#8220;<span class="smcap">Bachaliao</span>,&#8221;
&#8220;<span class="smcap">La Florida</span>,&#8221; &#8220;<span class="smcap">Tenustitan</span>,&#8221; &#8220;<span class="smcap">Parias</span>,&#8221; &#8220;<span class="smcap">Mundus Novus</span>,&#8221; &#8220;<span

<p>A second globe by Robertus de Bailly may be found in the
library of Mr. J. P. Morgan of New York City (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f52">52</a>).
This example, signed and dated &#8220;Robertus de Bailly 1530,&#8221;
and acquired a few years since, may be counted one of the
finest metal globes of the period. None can be referred to
which is in a better state of preservation, if we can accept
its mounting as the original.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> In Rosenthal&#8217;s catalogue
No. 100 it is referred to as a &#8220;Verrazzano-Globus,&#8221; which is
clearly an error, if there was thought of ascribing it to
Giovanni Verrazano, the explorer, or to his brother
Hieronimus, the chart maker. The outlines of its map of the
New World are clearly of Verrazanian origin (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f53">53</a>),
which therefore give to it a particular interest and value.</p>

<p>Harrisse, in 1896, called attention to his discovery of two
globes apparently of the early fourth decade of the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The first of these he refers to as a gilded copper sphere
about 12 cm. in diameter, and fashioned to contain the
mechanism by means of which it is made to revolve. It is
neither signed nor dated. At the extremity of the rod
passing through the sphere is an arrangement apparently for
attachment to a second piece of mechanism, probably a
planetarium. It is surrounded by a disc on which the hours
are engraved in Roman numerals. The geographical outlines
are clearly of Verrazanian origin, representing the New
World relatively long and narrow and having no Asiatic
connection. With few exceptions the nomenclature is in the
Latin language, but we read for instance &#8220;El pasaie de S.
Michel&#8221; and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
&#8220;Rio de las Amazonas&#8221;. The name &#8220;America&#8221;
appears only on the southern continent, where we also find
such legends as &#8220;Francisi Pizarri hoc m(onticu?) lo contra
indos insignis victoria anno 1533,&#8221; and off the coast of
Peru &#8220;Ulterius incognitum.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second of these globes is likewise of copper, having a
diameter of 21 cm. and carries the inscription &#8220;Christoff
Schiepp sculpsit. Augusta,&#8221; which is placed around a
cartouch especially designed for a representation of the
coat of arms of the Welser family. This family, it will be
remembered, figured conspicuously in connection with the
German attempt at the colonization of Venezuela. The
engraved title of the map is practically the same as that to
be found on the Paris gilt globe and reads &#8220;Nova et integra
universi orbis descriptio.&#8221; It omits, however, the legend
&#8220;Francesca&#8221; and &#8220;Verrazana sive nova Gallia,&#8221; which fact may
be due to its German origin. The nomenclature in Mexico and
in South America is very detailed. The La Plata River, for
example, as in the Gilt globe and in the Wooden globe, is
called &#8220;Sinus Juliani&#8221;; the Pacific is called &#8220;Oceanus
Magnus Gelanicus.&#8221; The austral land is referred to as &#8220;Terra
australis nuper inventa, sed nondum plene examinata.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the year 1533 Johann Sch&ouml;ner issued a small tract
bearing the title &#8216;Joannis Schoneri Carolostadii Opusculum
Geographicum ex diversorum libris ac cartis summa cura &amp;
diligentia collectum, accomodatum ad recenter elaboratum ab
eodem globum descriptiones terrenae.&#8217; &#8216;A geographical tract
of John Sch&ouml;ner of Carlstadt, extracted from various
books and maps with much care and diligence and arranged for
a recently elaborated globe, being a description of the
earth.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> This little book was dedicated to John Frederick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>of Saxony &#8220;Ex urbe Norica Id. Novembris Anno MDXXXIII.&#8221;
To it more than usual interest attaches. As the title
states, it was issued as an explanatory text for a new
globe,<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> while in referring to the geography of the New
World it clearly sets forth a reason for the changed notion
concerning that geography, to which allusion has already
been made,<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> a change from a belief in the independent
position of the new lands to a belief that these lands were
but a part of the continent of Asia. With reference to this
point Sch&ouml;ner says, &#8220;Unde longissimo tractu occidentem
versus ab Hispani terra est, quae Mexico et Temistitan
vocatur superiori India, quam priores vocavere Quinsay id
est civitatem coeli eorum lingui.&#8221; &#8220;By a very long circuit
westward, starting from Spain, there is a land called Mexico
and Temistitan in Upper India, which in former times was
called Quinsay, that is the city of Heaven, in the language
of the country.&#8221; He adds the statement, &#8220;Americus tamen
Vesputius maritima loca Indiae superioris ex Hispaniis
navigio ad occidentem palustrans, eam partem que superiore
Indiae est, credidit esse insulam, quam a suo nomine vocari
institituit. Alii vero nunc recentiores Hydrographi eam
terram ulterius ex alia parte invenerunt esse continentem
Asiae nam sic etiam ad Moluccas insulas superioris Indiae
pervenerunt.&#8221; &#8220;Americus Vespuccius, sailing along the coasts
of Upper India, from Spain to the west, thought that the
said part which is connected with Upper India, was an island
which he had caused to be called after his own name. But now
other hydrographers of more recent date have found that that
land (South America) and others beyond constitute a
continent, which is Asia, and so they reached as far as the
Molucca Islands in Upper India.&#8221; A later passage in this
tract is likewise interesting in this connection. After
noting that America had been called the fourth part of the
world he adds, &#8220;Modo vero per novissimas navigationes,
factas anno post Christum 1519 per Magellanum ducem navium
invictissimi Caesaris divi Caroli etc. versus <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>Moluccas insulas, quas alii
Moluquas vocant, in supremo oriente positas, eam terram
invenerunt esse continentem superioris Indiae, quae pars est
Asiae.&#8221; &#8220;But very lately, thanks to the very recent
navigations accomplished in the year 1519 A. C. by Magellan,
the commander of the expedition of the invincible, the
divine Charles etc. towards the Molucca Islands, which some
call Maluquas which are situated in the extreme east, it has
been ascertained that the said country (America) was the
continent of Upper India, which is a part of Asia.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seems very probable that the globe referred to in this
tract is one of those (Figs. 54, 54a), bearing neither date
nor name of maker, to be found in the Grand Ducal Library of
Weimar.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> This conclusion, it may be stated, is based upon
the fact of a striking agreement between the configurations
on the globe and the descriptions to be found in
Sch&ouml;ner&#8217;s tract. The date 1534, which appears on the
support, is doubtless of later origin than the globe itself,
just as the date 1510 inscribed on the horizon circle of the
Behaim globe is known not to indicate the year in which that
work was completed. Wieser expresses the conviction that
this globe is an improved reproduction of the one
constructed in the year 1523, and he notes the interesting
fact of its configurations resembling closely those of the
Orontius Finaeus map of 1531, believing that it was the

<p>The Schiepp globe, referred to above, appears to have been
constructed for a member of the Welser family, a rich
patrician of South Germany. To Raymond Fugger, likewise a
South German patrician, a member of a rich banker family of
Augsburg, one Martin Furtembach dedicated a terrestrial
globe which he had constructed in the year 1535.<a

of the most invincible Prince Charles V Emperor, and
Ferdinand the First King of the Romans, a Maecenas of
scholars, a most provident supporter of the poor in Christ,
Martin Furtembach lover of astronomy, composed and dedicated
this universal cosmographical figure, in the year of Christ
1535.&#8221; This globe, which we learn was taken from the Fugger
castle of Kirchbay to the Vienna Imperial Library, in what
year we do not know, seems to have disappeared some time
after 1734, since, as Harrisse notes, no reference to it can
be found after that date. It is described as a gilt copper
ball of large size and an object of real art, being
&#8220;ornamented on all sides with various figures of exquisite
engraving, and is supported by a figure of Atlas with his
right hand holding a compass, but with the rest of his body
supported by his left hand, in a stooping posture.&#8221;</p>

<p>In addition to the globes previously referred to as
belonging to the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, there is one
supposed to have been constructed about the year 1535. It is
neither signed nor dated, but is usually referred to as the
Paris Wooden globe.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> The diameter of the sphere is 20 cm.
It is without the usual mountings of meridian and horizon
circles but is supported by an iron rod attached to a wooden
base (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f55">55</a>), which rod serves as an axis about which
it may be revolved. A thick layer of paint covers the
surface of the ball, on which the geographical names,
legends, and configurations have been inscribed with a pen
in a running hand. The poor calligraphy suggests that it is
not the work of an expert cartographer, but of one who
somewhat hastily and carelessly had undertaken to copy a
globe map of the type represented in the work of Franciscus,
of the maker of the Paris Gilt globe, or of Sch&ouml;ner in
his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>globe of 1533. Meridians are represented at
intervals of ten degrees commencing at a prime meridian
which passes through the Cape Verde Islands, while the
parallels are similarly marked, the graduation being
indicated on the prime meridian. The globe maker has
retained in his representations the old climatic idea, of
which climates there are nine specifically designated. We
find on this globe such inscriptions as &#8220;Baccalarum Regio,&#8221;
with its neighboring &#8220;Pelagus Baccalarum,&#8221; &#8220;Terra
Francesca,&#8221; &#8220;Hispania Major,&#8221; &#8220;Terra Florida,&#8221; with the Gulf
of Mexico bearing the name &#8220;M. Cathayum&#8221; as in the Nancy
globe. The South American continent is conspicuously marked
as &#8220;America Nova Orbis Pars,&#8221; and contains in addition many
regional names. The western ocean, beginning with that part
which washes the coast of Mexico, thence southward, is
called &#8220;Mare di Sur,&#8221; &#8220;Mare Culuacanum,&#8221; &#8220;Mare Indicum
Australe,&#8221; &#8220;Mare Pacificum,&#8221; and &#8220;Oceanus Magellanicus.&#8221; The
location of the colony which was planted by Pizarro in 1532,
and which is called &#8220;S. Michaelis,&#8221; is made prominent.</p>

<p>Caspar Vopel,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> born at Medebach near Cologne, in the year
1511, was of that group of German cartographers and globe
makers active in the second quarter of the sixteenth century
in giving to the general public a knowledge of the great
geographical discoveries of the day. Though much of the
information through the maps which they constructed was
strikingly inaccurate, their work is none the less
interesting to the student of historical geography. It
appears that Vopel entered the University of Cologne in the
year 1526, that at a later date he became a professor of
mathematics in a Cologne gymnasium, and that he continued to
reside in this city until his death in the year 1561. During
these years he became well known as a maker of maps and
globes. Of his very large and important world map, issued in
the year 1558, and which so admirably sets forth his
geographical notion of an Asiatic connection of the New
World, an <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>original copy may be found in the collection
of Prince Liechtenstein, which is reproduced, after Giriva&#8217;s
redraughting, in Nordenski&ouml;ld&#8217;s &#8216;Facsimile Atlas.&#8217;<a
name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> In the history of
cartography his map of Europe and his Rhine map especially
merit a place of prominence.</p>

<p>Nine of his globes are known, most of which are constructed
as armillary spheres, having within the numerous armillae or
circles a small terrestrial globe, or at least that which
passes as a representation of the same. His first work of
which we have knowledge, now belonging to the city of
Cologne, and to be found in the collection of its archives,
is inscribed &#8220;Caspar Medebach opus hoc astronomicum fecit
1532 Martii.&#8221; It is a credit to the youthful artist and
cosmographer, suggesting, says Korth,<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> the possession of a
technic resembling that of D&uuml;rer. This is a celestial
globe 28 cm. in diameter, having its star map drawn by hand,
which is now somewhat discolored with age.</p>

<p>Four years later Vopel constructed a second celestial globe,
apparently a reproduction of the first but having its map
printed on gores which he pasted on the surface of the
sphere. It bears the inscription &#8220;Caspar Vopel, Medebach,
hanc Cosmogr. faciebat sphaeram Coloniae Ao 1536,&#8221; has the
same diameter as the one of 1532, and is now its companion
in the city archives of Cologne.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237"
class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p>The National Museum of Washington possesses a fine example
of Vopel&#8217;s work (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f9">9</a>), concerning which Mr. Maynard,
curator of Mechanical Technology, writes that &#8220;the globe in
this Museum is an armillary sphere of eleven metal rings,
4&frac12; inches in diameter, with a very small globe in the
center. The rings are elaborately inscribed with
astronomical signs and scales, with names in Latin. On one
of the rings is the inscription, &#8216;Caspar Vopel, Artium
Professor, Hanc Sphaeram Faciebat Colonia, 1541.&#8217;&#8221;<a
name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a

<p>In 1542 he constructed his first terrestrial globe, a copy
of which is to be found in the Cologne archives.<a name=
"FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> It has a diameter of 28
cm., its map gores, as in the case of the celestial <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>globe of 1536, being
printed from an engraved plate. Excepting the discoloration
of age and a slight indentation near the north pole, it is
well preserved. The title legend reads &#8220;Nova et integra
universi orbis descriptio.&#8221; &#8220;A new and complete description
of the entire globe.&#8221; A second legend, placed in the middle
Atlantic, reads &#8220;Caspar Vopel Medebach geographicam sphaeram
hanc faciebat Coloniae A. 1542.&#8221; &#8220;Caspar Vopel of Medebach
made this globe in 1542 at Cologne.&#8221; His terrestrial map
assures us of his acceptance of the idea that the American
continent could be but an extension of the continent of
Asia; that is, like his predecessor Sch&ouml;ner and others
of the second quarter of the sixteenth century, referred to
above, he had concluded after Magellan had found a
termination of the newly found transatlantic region at the
south, and no passageway from the Atlantic to the Pacific
north of the equator had been found though search had
frequently been made for the same, this country could
therefore no longer be considered as an independent
continent. The river &#8220;Cham,&#8221; which on his map he made to
empty into the Gulf of Mexico, he gives as the dividing line
between &#8220;Hispania Nova&#8221; and &#8220;Cathay.&#8221; There is striking
evidence that Vopel was acquainted with Orontius Finaeus&#8217;
map of 1531 or its source, as, for example, he writes across
the great austral continent, &#8220;Terra Australis recenter
inventa, sed nondum plene cognita,&#8221; adding the words &#8220;Anno
1499,&#8221; which also appear on the Paris Wooden globe of 1535.</p>

<p>In the Old Nordiske Museum of Copenhagen is an armillary
sphere of Vopel, composed of eleven brass rings representing
the equator, the ecliptic, the tropics, the polar circles,
etc., within which is a small terrestrial globe, on the
surface of which is a manuscript world map.&nbsp;Quad refers
to this globe in the following words: &#8220;Item ein Astrolabium
novum varium ac plenum das auff alle Landschafften (kann)
dirigiert werden beide den Mathematicis unnd Medicis sehr
nutz, in funffzehen St&ouml;ck und auff acht bogen <span class="pagenum"><a

"FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></p>

<p>On the circle representing the Tropic of Cancer is engraved
the legend &#8220;Caspar Vopell Medebach hanc sphaeram faciebat
Coloniae 1543.&#8221; &#8220;Caspar Vopel of Medebach made this globe in
Cologne in the year 1543.&#8221; On the bottom of the box in which
the globe is kept is a modern label reading &#8220;Nocolaus
Copernicus 1543 ... ty ... Brah.&#8221; Copernicus died in the
year designated, and Tycho Brahe was born in the year 1546.
It appears, therefore, that this globe once belonged to the
great Danish astronomer.</p>

<p>In the Library of Congress, acquired from L. Friedrichsen of
Hamburg, is a fine example of the work of Vopel.<a name=
"FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> This armillary sphere
of eleven rings, encircling a terrestrial globe 7.2 cm. in

Cologne in the year 1543,&#8221; while on the remaining circles
are engraved numerous cosmographical signs and names. The
terrestrial globe is covered with a manuscript map in

represent a terrestrial globe of wood, about 3 cm. in
diameter, on which the equator and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>the tropics are
represented, but no geographical details of any value appear
because of the small size of the ball.</p>

<p>A Vopel armillary sphere, apparently like the preceding,

<p>A somewhat detailed description, by J. H. Graf, of a Vopel
armillary sphere in the possession of the Herr
Forstinspector Frey of Bern, appeared in the year 1894, in
the Jahresbericht of the Geographical Society of Munich.<a
name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a
href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> It is composed of
twelve instead of eleven armillae, and at the common center
is a small terrestrial ball. The inscriptions appearing on
each of the several rings are given by Graf, and the work of
Vopel is compared with that of other map makers of the time.
On circle 3, for example, counting from the outermost, is a
citation from Ovid (Amores I. 6. 59), &#8220;Night, love, and wine
are not counselors of moderation.&#8221; On circle 5, which
represents the Tropic of Cancer, is the author and date
legend, reading &#8220;Caspar Vopellius Mathe. Profes. hanc
sphaeram faciebat Coloniae 1545.&#8221; On circle 7 we read &#8220;Fate
rules the world, all stands secure according to unchangeable
law, and the long lapse of time is marked by certain
course.&#8221; On one of the circles movable about the pole of the
ecliptic is the inscription &#8220;The sun, called Helios, moves
through the entire circle of the zodiac in 365 days and
about 6 hours.&#8221; Graf notes the striking similarity of this
sphere to that belonging to the Old Nordiske Museum of
Copenhagen, and adds to his paper a reproduction of the
terrestrial globe map in plane projection.<a name=
"FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> The feature common to
all of the Vopel maps, viz., the connection of the New and

at all, in keeping with his geographical ideas.</p>

<p>G&uuml;nther reports that there may be found in the Hof- und
Staatsbibliothek of Munich (Sig. Math. A 41, fol.), a volume
of drawings and engravings once belonging to the <span

<p>In the year 1859 Mr. Buckingham Smith obtained in the city
of Madrid an engraved copper globe of striking scientific
value and interest. On the death of Mr. Smith this globe,
now known as the Ulpius globe (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f57">57</a>), was purchased
by Mr. John David Wolf and later was presented to the
Library of the New York Historical Society, where it may now
be found among that society&#8217;s rich collection of historical
treasures.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> It is of large size, having a diameter of 39
cm., rests upon an oak base, and measuring from the bottom
of the base to the top of the iron cross which tips the
north polar axis, its entire height is 111 cm. The hollow
hemispheres of which the ball is composed are made to join
at the line of the equator, the parts being held together by
iron pins. In addition to its copper equatorial circle,
which is neatly graduated and engraved with signs of the
zodiac, it has a meridian and an hour circle of brass. On
the surface of the globe itself the principal parallels are
drawn, and meridians at intervals of thirty degrees, the
line of the ecliptic being very prominent, and the boundary
line proposed by Pope Alexander VI, marking a terminus for
the claims of Spain and Portugal to newly discovered
regions, is strikingly conspicuous, with its legend reaching
from pole to pole, &#8220;Terminus Hispanis et Lusitanis ab

<p>That a globe of such large dimensions, and of date so early,
should come down to our day scarcely injured in the
slightest degree, is a source of much delight to students of
early cartography and of early discovery and exploration.</p>

<p>Not the least interesting feature of its geographical record
in the New World is that wherein testimony is given to the
voyage of Verrazano in the year 1524. The outline of the
North American continent is strikingly like that given in
the Verrazano map of 1529 (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f58">58</a>), showing an isthmus
in the vicinity of Chesapeake Bay, beyond which stretches a
great unnamed sea to the west, called in some of the early
maps the Sea of Verrazano. Ulpius attests the discovery in
the following legend, &#8220;Verrazana sive Nova Gallia a
Verrazano Florentino comperta anno Sal. M.D.&#8221; &#8220;Verrazana or
New France discovered by Verrazano a Florentine in the year
of salvation 1500.&#8221; The date in this legend is taken to be
an incomplete rather than an erroneous record, the correct
date being obtainable from the following legend appearing on
the map of Hieronimus Verrazano, brother of the explorer,
&#8220;Verrazana sive nova gallia quale discopri 5 anni fa
giovanni di verrazano fiorentino per ordine et commandamento
del Christianissimo re di francia.&#8221; &#8220;Verrazana or New France
discovered five years since by Giovanni Verrazano a
Florentine by order and command of the Most Christian King
of France.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> Ulpius must have made use of <span class="pagenum"><a

drawing the outline of North America, though he did not copy
slavishly, as we find that he greatly improved on that map
in the trend he has given the Atlantic coast line of North
America, and in the numerous details he has inscribed. In
very many of the Atlantic coast names, however, there is a
practical agreement between those on the globe and those on
the map.</p>

<p>To the continent of South America is given both the name
&#8220;America&#8221; and &#8220;Mundus Novus,&#8221; while numerous provincial
names appear, as &#8220;Peru,&#8221; &#8220;Bresilia,&#8221; &#8220;Terra de giganti.&#8221; The
land areas of both the New and the Old World are liberally

the traditional belief in the existence of cannibals in
Mundus Novus being especially prominent. The oceans are made
to abound in sea monsters, and vessels sail hither <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>and thither over the
courses then followed by navigators. Though South America
has the entire coast line represented, that section
stretching southward from Peru is marked as &#8220;terra
incognita.&#8221; Separated from the mainland by the Strait of
Magellan, marked by the legend, &#8220;initium freti magellanici,&#8221;
is an extensive land area, that part lying to the southwest
of the strait being called &#8220;Regio Patalis,&#8221; that to the
southeast as &#8220;Terra Australis adhuc incomperta,&#8221; while from
this particular region there stretches away to the east, as
far as the meridian passing through the southern point of

<p>In the main Ptolemy served as a source of information for
the regions of the East, although much of the information
which the earlier years of the century had contributed to a
knowledge of that far-away country is recorded.</p>

<p>The large size of the globe gave opportunity for the
inscription of numerous geographical details, and of this
opportunity the engraver fully availed himself. It may well
be referred to as one of the most interesting of the early
globes, and its map records as possessing great scientific
value.</p>

<p>Tiraboschi alludes to a globe possessed by Cardinal Pietro
Bembo (1470-1547), citing a letter written by Giacomo
Faletti at Venice, June 3, 1561, to Alfonso II D&#8217;Este of
Ferrara, in which mention is made of the same. &#8220;I have
bought,&#8221; says Faletti, &#8220;the globe of Cardinal Bembo for
fifteen scudi which is the price of the metal composing it,
and I have given it out to be decorated hoping to make of it
the most beautiful globe which is possessed by any Prince in
the world. It will cost altogether 25 scudi.&#8221;<a

href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> This globe must
have been <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>made before the year 1547, in which year
occurred the death of the cardinal. Fiorini expresses the
opinion that it probably was owned by him while making his
residence at Padua, when, free from care, he was giving
himself to study and to the collection of scientific and
artistic objects.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></p>

<p>One of Spain&#8217;s distinguished chart makers of the middle of
the sixteenth century was Alonso de Santa Cruz
(1500-1572).<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> Although but few of his cartographical
productions are known, there is to be found in the survivals
abundant evidence of his marked ability. We learn concerning
him that by royal order of July 7, 1536, he was created
cosmographer of the Casa de Contratacion at a salary of
30,000 maravedis, that in this capacity it was his duty to
examine and pass upon sailing charts, that shortly after the
above-named date he became Cosmografo Major, and that some
time before his death, which occurred in the year 1572,
Philip II appointed him to the office of Royal Historian.<a
name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> His best-known work is
his &#8216;Yslario general del mondo,&#8217; of which three signed
manuscript copies are known, no one of which, however,
appears to be complete. Two of these copies are to be found
in the Royal Library of Vienna;<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255"
class="fnanchor">255</a> the third, now belonging to the City
Library of Besan&ccedil;on, was at one time in the
possession of Cardinal Granvella.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256"
class="fnanchor">256</a> The National Library of Madrid
possesses a fine manuscript atlas, which has been generally
attributed to Garcia Cespedes, since his name appears on the
frontispiece, but which now is thought by those who have
most carefully examined it to be the work of Santa Cruz.
There are evidences that it has been somewhat altered in
parts, which alterations may have been the work of
Cespedes.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<p>In addition to his &#8216;Yslario&#8217; we still have his remarkable
map of the city of Mexico, belonging to the University
Library of Upsala,<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> and one copy of his world map in gores

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>Though the form of the map suggests that it had been the
author&#8217;s intention to paste it on the surface of a prepared
sphere, there appears to be good reason for thinking that
this particular copy was not intended to serve him in a
terrestrial globe construction. It is surrounded with an
ornamental border finely executed in gold and white, and
stretching across the top is a waving scroll in which has
been written the inscription &#8220;Nova verior et integra totius
orbis descriptio nunc primum in lucem edita per Alfonsum de
Sancta Cruz Caesaris Charoli V. archicosmographum. A.D.
M.D.XLII.&#8221; &#8220;A very new and complete description of the whole
world now first prepared by Alfonso de Santa Cruz
Cosmographer Major of the Emperor Charles V. 1542.&#8221; The
original map is drawn on three connected sheets of
parchment, as Dahlgren states in his excellent monograph,
the total dimensions of which are 79 by 144 cm. In the lower
corner on the left is the dedication: &#8220;Potentiss. Caes.
Carlo V. Usi sumus et hic ad terrae, marisque simul,
demonstractionem, sectione alia, Augustiss. Caesar, per
equinotialem lineam Polum quemque, dividui ipsius globi,
singula medietas obtinens, depressoque utroque in planum
Polo, equinotialem ipsam secantes, rationem prospectivam
servavimus, quemadmodum et in alia, veluti solutis Polis,
itidem in planum discisis meridianis propalavimus, neque
pretermissis hic longitudinum latitudinumque graduum
parallelorum climatumque dimensionibus. Vale.&#8221; &#8220;O powerful
Caesar! we have, here also in this map of land and sea, made
use of a new division of the globe; namely, at the equator,
so that each half of the globe thus divided has one of the
poles as its center. By depressing the pole to the plane of
the equator and by making incisions from the equator to the
pole, we have made a projection similar to that presented to
the public on the other map with detached poles and with the
meridians separated on the same plane, without disregarding
the correct dimensions of the longitude, latitudes, degrees,
parallels, and climates. Farewell.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>The map represents the world in two hemispheres, a
northern and a southern, each drawn on thirty-six half gores
or sectors. The following appears to have been the method of
construction. With the poles as centers, and with a radius
equal to one fourth of the length of a meridian circle of
the globe he drew his large circle or circles representing
the equator and forming the bases of each of the half gores.
Each of the large or equatorial circles he divided into
thirty-six equal arcs, and from the points establishing such
divisions he drew a meridian line extending in each
hemisphere to the pole or center of his circle. These
meridian lines were graduated and lines or arcs representing
parallels of latitude were drawn intersecting them at
intervals of ten degrees, having the pole as the common
center in each hemisphere. Marking off on each of these
parallels or arcs both to right and left a distance
representing five degrees of the earth&#8217;s longitude, he thus
established the points through which to draw his meridians
which marked the boundaries of each sector, leaving between
the sectors equal spaces to be cut away should the sectors
be used for pasting on the surface of a sphere. Every fifth
meridian and every tenth parallel is drawn in black; the
equator, the tropics, the polar circles, and the prime
meridian are gilded. The prime meridian runs somewhat to the
west of the Island of Fayal. At longitude 20 degrees west is
the papal line of demarcation which is called &#8220;Meridianus
particionis,&#8221; crossing South America south of the mouth of
the Amazon. On the one side of this line in the southern
hemisphere appears the flag of Spain, on the other that of
Portugal, thus designating specifically the &#8220;Hemisperium
Regis Castelle,&#8221; and the &#8220;Hemisperium Regis Portugalie.&#8221;
California is referred to as &#8220;y<sup>a</sup> q&#772; descubrio el marq&#8217;s
del valle,&#8221; &#8220;island discovered by the Marquis del Valle,&#8221;
and the coast north of this point is called &#8220;ter&#772;a
q&#772; cnbio(?) a descubrio d&#275; ant<sup>o</sup> d&#8217; m&#275;doca,&#8221;
&#8220;land to discover which Don Antonio de Mendoza sent out an
expedition.&#8221; In drawing the outlines of his continents he
seems to have <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>made use of the best available sources. The
New World follows the Sevillan type, as represented in the
Ribeiro maps, particularly the eastern or Atlantic coast
regions, including, though in somewhat abbreviated form, the
references to Gomez, Ayllon, and Narvaez. There is no
distinct coast line north of California, which line follows
the meridian of 105 degrees as far north as the Arctic
circle, hence there is no positive representation of an
Asiatic connection, but rather the indication of a doubt, as
was indicated on maps of the type.</p>

<p>If Santa Cruz intended his peculiar gores to serve in the
construction of a terrestrial globe, we cannot find that he
impressed his method on the globe makers of the period. We
seem to have but one striking imitation of his work, viz.,
in the gore map of Florianas, to which reference is made
below.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></p>

<p>To that striking feature of many of the globe maps of the
second quarter of the sixteenth century, in which an Asiatic
connection of the New World is represented, attention has
been called in the preceding pages; there likewise has been
noted the fact that not a few of the map makers of the
period expressed a certain degree of doubt as to whether the
prevailing idea of the first quarter of the century (that
the lands discovered in the west constituted a veritable New
World) should be given over, preferring to omit altogether
the west and northwest coast line of North America, or to
make very indefinite allusion to the geography of the
region.</p>

<p>We now come to the consideration of a map and globe maker
who carries us back to the geographical notion of the
earlier years of the century, namely, to the idea that the
New World was nothing less than an independent continent.
The activities of Gerhard Mercator (1512-1594) (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f60">60</a>) were epoch making, and a
reference to him more detailed than has been accorded his
predecessors is fitting.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> He was a native of Rupelmunde, a
small town situated in the Pays <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>de Waes in East Flanders,
not far from the city of Antwerp. His parents died while he
was still a mere lad, but in a great-uncle he found a
faithful guardian and a generous benefactor, who took care
that his education should be the best that was afforded by
the schools of the Netherlands. In 1527, at the age of
fifteen, he entered the College of Bois-le-Duc in Brabant,
where he studied for three and one half years, and in 1530
he was matriculated as a student in the University of
Louvain, famous throughout Europe at that early date as a
center of learning.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> During his university career he
appears to have given much thought to the problems of
science, including the &#8220;origin, nature, and destiny&#8221; of the
physical universe. While these studies did not bear directly
upon that branch of science in which he was to win for
himself such marked distinction in later years, they
indicate the early existence of a desire for knowledge
scientific rather than for knowledge theological,
notwithstanding the fact that his guardian and patron was an
ecclesiastic.</p>

<p>In Gemma Frisius, an eminent professor of mathematics in the
University of Louvain, and at one time a pupil of Apianus,
he appears, as before noted, to have found a sympathetic
friend and counselor.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> It probably was Frisius who
suggested a career for the young scientist, since we find
him, shortly after graduation, turning his attention to the
manufacture of mathematical instruments, to the drawing,
engraving, and coloring of maps and charts, wherein he found
a vocation for the remainder of his life. In 1537 his first
publication, a map of Palestine, appeared, to which he gave
the title &#8220;Amplissima Terrae Sanctae descriptio.&#8221;<a
name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a
href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> Immediately
thereafter, at the instance of a certain Flemish merchant,
he undertook the preparation of a map of Flanders, making
for the same extensive original surveys. This map was issued
in the year 1540.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> Mercator&#8217;s first published map of the
world bears the date 1538. This map was drawn in the double
cordiform projection which seems first <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>to have been
employed by Orontius Finaeus in his world map of 1531.<a
name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> In this map Mercator
departed from the geographical notions generally entertained
at this particular period which made America an extension of
Asia. He represented the continent of Asia separated from
the continent of America by a narrow sea, an idea which
increased in favor with geographers and cartographers long
before actual discovery proved this to be a fact. This map
is one to which great importance attaches, but it is not the
first world map on which there was an attempt to fasten the
name America upon both the northern and the southern
continents of the New World, although it frequently has been
referred to as such; this honor, so far as we at present
know, belongs to a globe map referred to and briefly
described above.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> His large map of Europe, the draughting
of which appears to have claimed much of his time for a
number of years, was published in the year 1554, and
contributed greatly to his fame as a cartographer.<a
name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a
href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> In 1564 appeared
his large map of England,<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> and in the same year his map of
Lorraine based upon his own original surveys.<a
name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a
href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> In the year 1569
a master work was issued, this being his nautical chart, &#8220;ad
usum navigantium,&#8221; as he said of it, based upon a new
projection which he had invented.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> It is the original
chart setting forth the Mercator projection which is now so
extensively employed in map making. In the year 1578 he
issued his revised edition of the so-called Ptolemy maps,
and eight years later these same maps again, revised with
the complete text of Ptolemy&#8217;s work on geography. Mercator
expressly stated it to be his purpose, in this last work,
not to revise the text in order to make it conform to the
most recent discoveries and geographical ideas, but the
rather to have a text conforming, as nearly as possible, to
Ptolemy&#8217;s original work. This edition still ranks as one of
the best which has ever been issued. His great work, usually
referred to as his &#8216;Atlas of Modern Geography,&#8217; the first
part of which appeared in 1585, and a second part in 1590,
was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>not completed during his lifetime, though but four
months after his death, in the year 1594, Rumold Mercator
published his father&#8217;s collection of maps, adding a third
part to those which previously had been issued. It was this
publication which bore the title &#8216;Atlas sive cosmographicae
meditationes de fabrica mundi et fabricati figura.&#8217;
Apparently for the first time the term &#8220;atlas&#8221; had here been
employed for a collection of maps, a term which we know had
its origin with Gerhard Mercator himself. A reference to his
general cartographical work more detailed than the above
cannot here find place. It is his globes which call for
special consideration.</p>

<p>There is reason for thinking it was Nicol&aacute;s Perrenot,
father of Cardinal Granvella, who suggested to Mercator the
construction of a globe; it at least was to this great Prime
Minister of the Emperor Charles V that he dedicated his
first work of this character, a terrestrial globe dated
1541.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> That Mercator had constructed such a globe had long
been known through a reference in Ghymmius&#8217; biography, yet
it had been thought, until 1868, that none of the copies of
this work had come down to us. In that year there was
offered for sale, in the city of Ghent, the library of M.
Benoni-Verelst and among its treasures was a copy of
Mercator&#8217;s engraved globe gores of the year 1541, which were
acquired by the Royal Library of Brussels, where they may
still be found. Soon thereafter other copies of these gores,
mounted and unmounted, came to light in Paris, in Vienna, in
Weimar, in N&uuml;rnberg, and later yet other copies in
Italy, until at present no less than twelve copies are
known.</p>

<p>These gores were constructed to cover a sphere 41 cm. in
diameter, and the map represents the entire world, with its
seas, its continents, and its islands. The names of the
various regions of the earth, of the several empires, and of
the oceans are inscribed in Roman capital letters; the names
of the kingdoms, of the provinces, of the rivers, are
inscribed in cursive Italic letters, while for the names of
the several <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>peoples he employed a different form of
letter. The gores, twelve in number, were engraved and
printed in groups of threes (Fig. <a href="#f61">61</a>), each gore having an
equatorial diameter of thirty degrees. Mercator worked out
mathematically the problem dealing with the proper relation
of the length of each of the gores to its width, or of its
longer diameter to its shorter, in his endeavor to devise a
map as nearly perfect as possible in shape for covering a
ball, knowing full well the difficulty of fitting a flat
surface to one that is curved. Each of the gores he
truncated twenty degrees from the poles, and for the polar
areas he prepared a circular section drawn according to the
rule applicable to an equidistant polar projection. It
appears, as before noted, that he was the first to apply
this method in globe construction.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;61. Six of Twelve Terrestrial Globe Gores by

<p>The ecliptic, the tropics, and the polar circles are
represented at their proper intervals, with other parallels
at intervals of ten degrees, and meridians at intervals of
fifteen degrees. As in his double cordiform map of 1538, his
prime meridian passes through the island of &#8220;Forte Ventura,&#8221;
one of the Fortunate Islands of the ancients, but which had
long been known as the Canary Islands. To his globe map he
added a feature of special value to seamen. From the
numerous compass or wind roses, distributed with some
regularity over its surface, he drew loxodromic lines, or
curved lines cutting the meridians at equal angles.<a
name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a
href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> This feature
could not have failed to win the approval of navigators,
since they well knew that the previous attempts to represent
these rhumbs as straight lines on maps drawn on a
cylindrical projection, led to numerous errors in
navigation. A second somewhat curious and interesting
feature of his globe, a feature which I do not recall to
have noticed in any other, is the representation in various
localities on land and on sea of certain stars, his idea
being that he could thus assist the traveler to orient
himself at night. In his list of stars on his globe map, we
find, for example, &#8220;Sinister humerus Bo&ouml;tes&#8221; near
latitude 40 degrees north, longitude <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>210 degrees;
&#8220;Corona septentrionalis&#8221; near latitude 29 degrees north,
longitude 227 degrees; &#8220;Cauda Cygni&#8221; near latitude 44
degrees north, longitude 305 degrees; &#8220;Humerus Pegasus&#8221; near
latitude 12 degrees north, longitude 340 degrees; &#8220;Crus
Pegasi&#8221; near latitude 26 degrees north, longitude 339
degrees; six of the important stars in &#8220;Ursa Major,&#8221;
including &#8220;Stella Polaris,&#8221; and in the present California,
somewhat strangely prophetic, &#8220;Caput Draconis.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the ninth gore, counting from the prime meridian
eastward, is a legend giving the author&#8217;s name, the date of
issue, and a reference to the publication privilege, reading
&#8220;Edebat Gerardus Mercator Rupelmundanus cum privilegio Ces
Maiestatis ad an sex Lovanii an 1541.&#8221; &#8220;Published by Gerard
Mercator of Rupelmunde under the patent of His Imperial
Majesty for six years at Louvain in the year 1541.&#8221; In a
corresponding position on the seventh gore is the dedication
&#8220;Illustris: Dn&#333; Nicolao Perrenoto Domino &agrave;
Granvella Sac. Caesaree Ma<sup>ti</sup> &agrave; consiliis primo
dedecat&#361;.&#8221; &#8220;Dedicated to the very distinguished
Seigneur Nichol&aacute;s Perrenot, Seigneur de Granvella;
first counselor of His Imperial Majesty,&#8221; over which is the
coat of arms of the Prime Minister. On gore six we read &#8220;Ubi
&amp; quibus argumentis Lector ab aliorum descriverimus
editione libellus noster indicabit.&#8221; &#8220;Reader, where and in
what subjects we have copied from the publications of other
men will be pointed out in our booklet,&#8221; in which there
appears to be a reference to an intended publication wherein
his globe was to be described and its uses indicated. No
such work by Mercator is known to exist, although we find
that in the year 1552 he issued a small pamphlet bearing the
title &#8216;Declaratio insigniorum utilitatum quae sunt in globo
terrestri, caelesti et anulo astronomico. Ad invictissimum
Romanum Imperatorus Carolum Quintum.&#8217; &#8216;A presentation of the
particular advantages of the terrestrial, celestial, and
armillary spheres. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>Dedicated to the invincible Roman
Emperor Charles Fifth.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></p>

<p>He tells us in one of his legends how to find the distance
between two places represented on the globe, observing, &#8220;Si
quorum voles locor&#363; distanti&#257; cognoscere ...
tr&#257;sferto, hic tibi, q&#772; libet particula
&#301;tercepta millaria referet, Hisp: 18, Gal: 20, Germ:
15, Milia pass; 60, Stadia 500,&#8221; from which it appears that
he gives as the value of an equatorial degree 60 Italian
miles or 500 stadia, equivalent to 18 Spanish miles, to 20
French miles, and to 15 German miles. Finding numerous
errors in Ptolemy&#8217;s geography of the Old World, he tells us
that he undertook to correct these errors from the accounts
of Marco Polo, whom he calls &#8220;M. Paulo Veneto,&#8221; and from the
accounts of Vartema, whom he calls &#8220;Ludovico, Rom Patricii.&#8221;
Between parallels 50 degrees and 60 degrees south latitude
and meridians 60 degrees and 70 degrees east longitude is
the inscription &#8220;Psitacorum regio a Lusitanis anno 1500 ad
millia passum bis mille praetervectis, sic appellata quod
psitacos elat inaudite magnitudinis, ut qui ternos cubitos
aequent longitudine.&#8221; &#8220;Region of parrots discovered by the
Portuguese in 1500 who sailed along 2000 miles; so called
because it has parrots of unheard-of size, measuring three
cubits in length.&#8221; America, he notes, is called New India,
&#8220;America a multis hodie Noua India dicta.&#8221; In the Antarctic
region an inscription tells of the notion entertained by
many geographers of his day and by some in an earlier day,
that in addition to the four known parts of the world,
Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, there is here a fifth
part of large size stretching for a number of degrees from
the pole, which region is called &#8220;terra Australe.&#8221; Mercator
undertook, in Chapter X of his &#8216;Atlas,&#8217; to demonstrate that
a large Antarctic continent must of necessity exist as a
balance to the weight of the other four continents or parts
of the world lying in the northern hemisphere.<a

<p>In 1551 he issued his copper engraved gores for a celestial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>globe, dedicating the same to Prince George of Austria,
natural son of the Emperor Maximilian, who was Bishop of
Brixen, Archbishop of Valencia, and Bishop of Li&egrave;ge
in the year 1544. A set of these gores was likewise acquired
by the Royal Library of Brussels at the same time it
acquired the terrestrial globe gores referred to above.<a

Signed by Oberburger and Soete.&#8221; It clearly was the
intention that this should serve as the companion of his
terrestrial globe of 1541, described above, since the gores
are of the same size, each of the twelve being truncated in
the same manner, and the circular section being prepared for
the polar areas. Mercator&#8217;s merits as an astronomer by no
means equaled his merits as a geographer. However, his
celestial globe, by reason of the exactness of the
composition, by reason of its simplicity, and by reason of
the artistic skill exhibited in the workmanship, is a most
worthy work of that great scientist. On this globe are
represented <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>the forty-eight constellations of Ptolemy,
to which have been added three which he calls Antinous,
Lepus and Cincinnus, the first formed of six stars and
located on the equator below the constellation Aquila, the
second in the southern hemisphere under the feet of Orion,
and the third in the northern hemisphere near the tail of
Ursa Major.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> His constellations, as well as the principal
stars in the same, have, in the majority of instances,
Greek, Latin, and Arabic names. It does not appear that
Mercator felt himself bound to a strictly scientific
representation and interpretation of the celestial bodies,
for he pays more or less homage to astrology, inscribing on
the horizon circle of his globe the horoscope as used by
astrologists in calculating nativities, perhaps recognizing,
from a business standpoint, the advantage of an appeal to
certain superstitions which he found still lingering among
both the learned and the unlearned.</p>

<p>By reason of their size and the great care with which they
had been prepared, his globes must have found general favor,
not only with those of rank and distinction, for whom copies
<i>de luxe</i> were issued, but with geographers and scholars in
general, who found it possible to obtain at a comparatively
small price the more modest copies. That they found favor in
Germany is assured us by Mercator&#8217;s correspondence with
Camerarius of N&uuml;rnberg, in which mention is made of the
sale of six pairs of his globes in that city, and of others
at the Frankfort book market.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> Thomas Blundeville tells us
in his &#8216;Exercises&#8217; that Mercator&#8217;s globes were in common use
in England until 1592,<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> and the number of his globes which
have become known since 1868 in various parts of Europe
assure us that copies of that master&#8217;s work must have been
easily obtainable by those interested. Ruscelli, in
referring to printed spheres; notes that they usually were
made small, and that those of large size are not exact, but
he adds that he had seen some that were three and one half
palms in diameter, such as that which years <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>ago Aurelio Porcelaga sent
to him to examine, printed in Germany, and given to him by
Monseigneur Granvella, to whom or to whose father, not
recalling which, it had been dedicated, but which he
remembered was very beautiful and very exact, being
evidently engraved by one very expert, judged by the beauty
of the design and the artistic quality of the letters.<a
name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> Fiorini is of the
opinion that these globes were Mercator&#8217;s, and that they
were carried into Italy in the late years of the sixteenth
century when a friendly relationship existed between certain
Italian princes and the Spanish authorities then ruling in
Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></p>

<p>Attention has been called above to the acquisition by the
Royal Library of Brussels of a copy each of the terrestrial
and the celestial globe gores, and that the discovery of the
same having created an especial interest in his work, other
examples were soon brought to light in Italy, in Spain, in
France, in Germany, and in Austria. A pair may be found in
the Mus&eacute;um Astronomique of Paris, a pair in the Royal
Library of Vienna, a pair in the Germanisches National
Museum in N&uuml;rnberg, a pair in the archives of the town
of St. Nicholas de Waes, a copy of the terrestrial globe in
the Grand Ducal Library of Weimar, a copy of the celestial
in the Convent of Adamont, Istria, and a copy of the
terrestrial in the Convent of Stams, Tyrol. Dr. Buonanno,
director of the Biblioteca Governativa of Cremona, in 1890
briefly described a pair of Mercator&#8217;s globes belonging to
that library, and what he was able to learn as a result of
their damaged condition of Mercator&#8217;s method of construction
is not without interest. He found that over a framework
composed of thin, narrow strips of wood had been pasted
first a cloth covering, over this a thin layer of plaster
and that to this was added a covering of a pastelike
substance about six or seven millimeters in thickness,
consisting of plaster, wood fiber, or sawdust, and glue. On
this prepared surface had then been pasted the engraved
gores. The learned librarian&#8217;s conjecture as to the manner
in which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>these globes found their way into Italy, if
correct, is of interest, pointing as it does to the
formation of a great art collection in that period. He
recalls that Caesar Speciano, Bishop of Cremona, had been
sent in 1592 as nuncio to Germany, and that he had occasion,
during his mission, to attend to certain matters pertaining
to the inheritance of William, Duke of Cleves, in whose
country there must still have existed the workshop of
Mercator. The opinion is expressed that on the return of the
Bishop to Italy he carried with him many books and art
objects, which had come into his hands either through
purchase or through gift, and that the same passed into the
possession of the Cremona Library, a library belonging to
the Jesuits until the time of the suppression of that
order.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></p>

<p>The Biblioteca Municipale of Urbania possesses a pair of
Mercator&#8217;s globes of 1541 and 1551, which are reported to be
in a fair state of preservation. It is thought that they may
have come into the library&#8217;s collection through the last
reigning member of the house, Duke Francesco Maria.</p>

<p>In the Museo Astronomico of Rome two copies of the
terrestrial globe of 1541 may be found, and a copy of the
celestial of the year 1551. These, it will be seen from the
reproduction (Fig. <a href="#f62">62</a>), are not in a good state of
preservation, although a very considerable portion of the
map records can be read.</p>

<p>In addition to the globes of Mercator referred to above, it
is known that after taking up his residence in Duisburg he
constructed a small celestial globe of glass, on the surface
of which he engraved with a diamond the several
constellations, and that he likewise constructed a very
small terrestrial globe of wood, apparently such as were
later called pocket globes, having all geographical records
given as accurately presented as on the larger globes.<a
name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a
href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></p>

<p>How great was the direct influence of Mercator on globe
making activities, it may not be easy to trace, but the
evidence seems to be conclusive, as Breusing has noted, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>his should be counted the greatest, among those active
within this field, for fifty years and more, following the
issue of his first work in the year 1541. It is among the
Italian globe makers, and those in the peninsula interested
in such instruments, that we seem to find the first and most
striking evidence of his influence, which will be noted in
the following pages.</p>

<p>Giovanni Gianelli of Cremona is referred to, by certain
early Italian writers, as a clock and globe maker of
remarkable ability,<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> the justice of which estimate is
abundantly supported by the character of the one example of
his handiwork extant, belonging to the Biblioteca Ambrosiana
of Milan, to which it came from the collection of Canon
Manfred Sett&agrave;la about the middle of the seventeenth
century. This is an armillary sphere of brass, the diameter
of its largest or zodiacal circle being 14 cm. This circle
is graduated and has engraved on its outer surface the names
of the twelve constellations. It is likewise provided with a
graduated equatorial circle, with polar circles and those
representing the tropics. At the common center of the
several rings is a small ball, 5 cm. in diameter, which is
made to serve as a terrestrial globe. On one of the circles
is the inscription &#8220;Janellus MDXLIX Mediolani fecit,&#8221; and we
further find inscribed the name &#8220;Hermetis Delphini,&#8221; which
perhaps tells us of a one-time possessor. In a volume
describing the museum of Canon Sett&agrave;la, and issued in
the year 1666, Gianelli and his work are thus referred to:</p>

<p>&#8220;To that great man Gianelli of Cremona there is due great
honor, whose personal qualities made him an especial
favorite of His Catholic Majesty Philip II. Among the many
globes which he constructed our museum possesses one of
surpassing excellence, in that it exhibits, in addition to
other movements, that which astrologers call the movement of
trepidation, and which movement was set forth in theory by
Thebit.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></p>

<p>The Emperor Charles V, when in Pavia, we are told, had <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>his attention directed to
an armillary sphere constructed by Dondi in the fourteenth
century. On finding this sphere much injured by rust and
usage he called upon Giovanni Gianelli to restore it, but it
was reported to be beyond repair. Thereupon the Emperor gave
direction to have the sphere reproduced, which, when
completed, was carried by His Majesty to Spain. No trace of
this work by Gianelli can now be found.</p>

<p>Girolamo Fracastoro, a distinguished Italian physician, a
famous man of letters, and a great philosopher of the first
half of the sixteenth century, was also a skilful globe
maker, as we learn from Ramusio,<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286"
class="fnanchor">286</a> and from the sketch of his life which
usually appears as an introduction to his collected works.<a
name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a
href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></p>

<p>Vasari also gives us certain information concerning him,
noting that he assisted Francesco dai Libri in the
construction of his large globe,<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288"
class="fnanchor">288</a> and we are led to believe that he was
often consulted as an expert by globe makers of his day.
While none of those he may have constructed are extant, what
is known of his interest in these aids to geographical and
astronomical studies entitles him here to a word of
reference.</p>

<p>Ramusio says<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> that on the occasion of a visit, with the
architect Michele S. Micheli, to the home of their common
friend, Girolamo Fracastoro, at Caffi, they found him in the
company of a gentleman, a very distinguished philosopher and
mathematician, who was showing him an instrument based on a
newly found movement of the heavens; that after they had
considered for some time this new movement, they had brought
before them a large and very detailed globe of the entire
world, and about this the distinguished gentleman began to
speak. Fiorini argues, somewhat ingeniously, that this globe
may have been one constructed by Mercator in 1541, if not
one by Libri, in the making of which Fracastoro himself had
assisted. The letters of Fracastoro assure us that he made
use of globes in his geographical and astronomical <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>studies, and that his
friends did likewise. January 25, 1533, he wrote Ramusio,
&#8220;If you should chance to speak to that master who made your
metal spheres, I should like you to ascertain how much a
simple but perfect one, one foot in diameter, would cost.&#8221;
Writing again to Ramusio January 10, 1534, concerning the
&#8220;Southern Cross,&#8221; he adds: &#8220;Just reflect a little, and if
you have not sent away the celestial globe, look at that
Centaurus and you will find all that I am writing to you.
You might perhaps write about these doubts to Mr. Oviedo, or
perhaps I might; it would be a good idea and we might ask
him about the very prominent star in the right foot to
ascertain whether it is a separate star or is one of those
in the &#8216;Southern Cross.&#8217;&#8221; On the twenty-fifth of January,
1548, he again wrote to Ramusio: &#8220;On my globe Zeilan is just
below the Cape of Calicut, on the equinoctial line, and it
may be that which Jambolo discovered was Zeilan or
Taprobana; I am inclined to believe it was Taprobana.&#8221; His
letter of May 10, 1549, also to Ramusio, is of special
interest, indicating, as it does, his estimate of the value
of terrestrial and celestial globes in the study of
astrology (astronomy) and geography. &#8220;In regard to what you
write me about M. Paolo, I thoroughly approve of his taking
up the sacred study of astrology and geography, subjects of
study for every learned gentleman and nobleman, as he would
have as his guide and teacher the very well-known
Piedmontese to whom we owe so many excellent things, but
first I should advise you to have M. Paolo construct two
solid spheres. On one of these should be represented all the
celestial constellations, and the circles should all have
their place, that is to say, not as Ptolemy represents the
stars as they were located in his time, but according to the
investigations of our own times, that is, about twenty
degrees further east. The other should be a terrestrial
globe constructed according to modern ideas, which he should
always follow in his studies. He will use the first globe
for a thousand and one things; it will be his <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>guide by day and by night,
and by making use of the quadrant he will be able easily to
locate the things to be seen in the heavens. Then when he
shall have been well started I want that you should have him
read that little book of mine on homocentricity, wherein he
will be able to learn what astrology is, but for the present
let him learn ordinary astrology which has been treated in
so barbarous a manner as to lose much of its dignity.&#8221;
Writing again from Verona January 21, 1550, to Paolo, after
telling him what he should point out to his father, he says:
&#8220;You will tell him also that M. Michele di San Michele has
seen my globe and that he likes it.... When I come I will
make note of the principal places, for I desire very much to
verify them with the report of navigators telling what they
have found, concerning which matter, I think, no one knows
more than you do, or especially your distinguished father.
As to the celestial sphere, I should like very much to
compare one I have with the one your father is having made,
that I may learn how the constellations compare, and how
many more of the fixed stars have been inserted. I have
changed their position twenty degrees. Whether he agrees
with me or not I do not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marcello Cervino was born in the year 1501. For his
attainments in the field of literature, Italian, Latin, and
Greek, in philosophy, jurisprudence, and mathematics he held
a place of great distinction among his contemporaries. In
the year 1539 he was made a cardinal prefect of the Vatican,
and the year 1555 he was elevated to the Papacy, but died
twenty-one days thereafter.</p></div>

<p>There is an extensive Verrazano literature. The original
letter written by the explorer to Francis I of France, under
whose auspices he had sailed on his voyage of discovery in
the year 1524, seems to have been lost, but copies of the
same, it may have been with alterations, were sent to
Verrazano&#8217;s relatives and friends in Italy. Ramusio, in the
year 1556, and Hakluyt, in the year 1582, published one of
these copies, and it has since been frequently printed.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, there exists a manuscript copy,
sometimes referred to as the Florentine or Magliabechian
codex, a fragmentary copy in the Academy of Cimento, and a
manuscript copy recently discovered, which from the name of
its present owner may be called the Cellere codex. Hall has
printed the original document and has given an excellent
translation of the same.</p></div>

his death there was also left a paper in manuscript,

<p>A comparison with the Orontius Finaeus double cordiform map
of the year 1531 is interesting. It has been stated that
Mercator copied the work of Finaeus. The projections appear
to be practically identical, but it will be noted that
Mercator represents the New World as independent of the Old
World, whereas Finaeus represents the Asiatic connection.

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><b>MONG</b> those interested in map and globe making, in the third
quarter of the sixteenth century, none seems to have
surpassed the Italians. In the art of map engraving they
attained to a high degree of merit, and much of the finest
work of the middle of the century is the product of the
peninsula. With few exceptions it is the Italians who hold
the field in this line of scientific activity. There can
undoubtedly be traced here the influence of Mercator, but
there appear to have been not a few who worked on what might
be called independent lines. The interest of illustrious
personages in the construction and the possession of globes
prompted activity in this field. While the number extant, of
those manufactured in this period, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>is not large, there
are not a few references in letters and in scientific works
assuring us of the construction of many which cannot now be
traced.</p>

<p>We may call attention first to Fran&ccedil;ois De Mongenet,
who appears to have been a native of Franche-Comt&eacute;
and well known in his day as a globe maker. He was, however,
quite forgotten until a few years since, when a copy each of
his terrestrial and celestial globe gores was purchased by
the antiquarian Rosenthal of Munich,<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> and sold to Mr.
Kalbfleisch of New York, from whose collection they passed
into the possession of the New York Public Library. Since
this discovery of De Mongenet&#8217;s interesting work, a number
of copies of the same or of subsequent editions have come to
light, both of the terrestrial and of the celestial globe,
some of which copies are mounted, some remain unmounted,
some are of his first edition of the year 1552, others are
of the second edition, undated, somewhat altered, and
printed in Italy. All of his globes are of small size,
having each a diameter of about 85 mm.</p>

<p>De Mongenet was born at Vesoul in France, and in the
university of his town he studied medicine, mathematics, and
probably geography or cosmography. There seems to be but
little known concerning the family to which Fran&ccedil;ois
belonged, but such details as it was possible to gather
Marcel brought together in a carefully prepared paper.<a
name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a
href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> This author
thinks it probable that he could be counted among the circle
of learned and distinguished men whom Granvella was
accustomed to bring together in his palace at
Besan&ccedil;on on frequent occasions during the five years
he passed in that city after he had given over his
administration of the Netherlands. If true, there may here
be found a connecting link between De Mongenet and Mercator,
remembering that the latter dedicated his globe of 1541 to
the father of the distinguished cardinal statesman.<a
name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a
href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> The suggestion of
Mercator&#8217;s influence on De Mongenet appears quite evident on
a comparison of the outlines of their globe maps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>The Lenox copy of the terrestrial gores (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f63">63</a>)
is dedicated to &#8220;Eximio Viro: D:I:P: A Monte Maiore,&#8221; while
the celestial gores (<a href="#f64">Fig.&nbsp;64</a>) carry the dedication
&#8220;Eximio Viro D. Gabrieli a Tiesbach.&#8221; Marcel is of the
opinion that the dedication of the first to &#8220;Monte Maiore&#8221;
refers to a prelate of the illustrious house of Granmont,
whose name in the sixteenth century was often spelled
Grandmont, and that Gabrieli Tiesbach (Diesbach) belonged to
a family of Besan&ccedil;on, originally from Freiburg, and
that he was a knight of St. George. The author and date
legend of the first reads &#8220;Faciebat Franciscus De Mongenet
anno 1552,&#8221; while that of the second reads &#8220;Elaborabat
Franciscus De Mongenet. Anno 1552.&#8221; The gores of each map as
printed measure from pole to pole 13.7 cm., the length of
the equatorial line being 27.5 cm. Around each set there is
a narrow black border. A zodiacal circle is likewise printed
on the first sheet 5 cm. in width, and of sufficient length
to encompass the gores when mounted, being divided into
twelve parts, in which, in regular order, are the figures of
the twelve zodiacal constellations. With but few exceptions
the several inscriptions are in small capitals, and are well
executed.</p>

<p>The draughtsmanship which the terrestrial map exhibits in
all parts, as well as that exhibited by the celestial,
displays skill of very considerable merit. The general
outline of the New World&#8217;s coasts is quite as well done as
on any of the maps of the day, the Pacific coast line of
North America sweeping in a great curve northward and
northeastward, while a great broad stretch of ocean
separates the continent from Asia. In North America we find
only the inscriptions &#8220;Hispania maior&#8221; and &#8220;baccalea.&#8221; South
America bears the inscription &#8220;America,&#8221; so extended as to
cover the continent. The names of geographical localities
are comparatively few, the size of the globe making it
impossible to insert many details.</p>

<p>On a second pair of De Mongenet&#8217;s globes, referred to by
Marcel, the dedications and inscriptions differ slightly
from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>those given above. On the terrestrial gores we find
&#8220;Illustr. Ac Rever. D. D. CL. A. Bauma Arch. Bis.,&#8221; and the
signature, &#8220;Elaborabat Francis. De Mongenet. V. E. V.&#8221; On
the celestial gores we read &#8220;Illustr. Ac Rever. D. D. CL. A.
Bauma Arch. Bis. E. V.,&#8221; the signature &#8220;Elaborabat
Franciscus De. Mongenet. V.,&#8221; and the privilege &#8220;Cum
privilegio Pont. Max. Sqe. Ven.&#8221; Citing again Marcel&#8217;s
opinion, the Claudio de la Baume referred to was Archbishop
of Besan&ccedil;on, and the letter &#8220;V&#8221; placed after the name
of the globe maker doubtless refers to Vesoul, his
birthplace; the letters &#8220;E. V.&#8221; may stand either for
&#8220;Excusum Venetiis,&#8221; indicating the city in which the work
was done, or for &#8220;Enea Vico,&#8221; the name of the actual
engraver of the gores, who is known as having been at that
time an engraver of medals, being now especially remembered
for his medals of the first twelve Emperors of Rome.<a
name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a
href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></p>

<p>The gores of the first edition were printed from engraved
wooden blocks; the second were printed from engraved copper
plates which exhibit a very superior workmanship, and it is
to be noted that many more names appear on the terrestrial
gores than on those of the first edition. Ruscelli, in his
edition of Ptolemy of 1561, makes mention of &#8220;a little
globe, published lately by Francesco Mongonetto
Borgonone,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> which allusion would seem to indicate a
reference to the second edition and to its issue near 1561.
Although this second edition contains more names than does
the first, it gives little indication that the author had
knowledge of discoveries subsequent to the first edition.
Like Mercator he represents North America as separated from
Asia, as before noted, by a wide expanse of ocean, to which
no name has been given, and like Mercator he lays down a
large austral continent. His globes could hardly have been
received with as much favor as were those by his Flemish
contemporary, since they were so small as to appear like
mere playthings.</p>

<p>Of the first edition, other than those gores to be found in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>the New York Public Library, a set of the terrestrial
and the celestial gores is in the British Museum, and of the
terrestrial in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum of
N&uuml;rnberg.</p>

<p>Of the second edition, copies of the unmounted gores may be
found in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, in the British
Museum, in the private library of Prince Trivulzio of Milan.
A mounted pair of the second edition may be found in the
Osservatorio Astronomico of Rome (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f65">65</a>), and in
addition a second example of the celestial globe, which is
described as having excellent mountings of brass, so
arranged as to make possible a revolution of the globe both
on an equatorial axis and an axis of the ecliptic. Its
horizon circle is supported by two brass semicircles, the
whole resting on four wooden columns of modern construction,
and these in turn resting on representations of lion&#8217;s paws
in bronze. An example of the mounted terrestrial globe is
said to belong to the collection of Sr. Bazolle of Belluno,
which example once belonged to the Counts of Pilloni.</p>

<p>Attention has been called to the peculiar gore map of Santa
Cruz,<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> and to the fact that his method of construction
seems not to have won favor. We, however, find among the map
makers of Italy, in the period of which we are now speaking,
one Antonius Florianus,<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> who, if not copying the plan of
Santa Cruz, followed closely his scheme. His map, of which
numerous copies are known (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f66">66</a>), seems to have been
prepared for mounting on a ball, although no such mounted
example can now be located. With the poles as centers, and
with a radius equal to one quarter of the circumference of
the sphere he proposed to construct, he drew his equatorial
circles, which thus gave him two hemispheres, respectively,
a northern and a southern; in the same manner he drew his
parallels at intervals of ten degrees, using for each the
common polar centers. In each of the hemispheres he drew
thirty-six sectors, each sector being made to represent ten
degrees of longitude, and they were <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>so shaped
mathematically that their combined width at the equator
would equal the circumference of the sphere of which the
selected radius, referred to above, represented one quarter
of that circumference. When prepared for mounting, the
vacant space between the several sectors could be cut away,
leaving the thirty-six engraved sectors, on which the world
map appeared, to be pasted on the surface of the sphere. The
scheme which Florianus devised was practically that employed
by Werner in his equivalent cordiform projection, and
likewise that of Finaeus and Mercator.<a name="FNanchor_297"
id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="f66" id="f66"></a>

alt="Globe Gores of Antonius Florianus, 1555." title="" /></a>

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;66. Globe Gores of Antonius Florianus, 1555.</p> </div>

<p>It was the eighteenth of January, in the year 1555, that
Florianus obtained a copyright from the Venetian senate for
his map,<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> but it is probable he died before the map
appeared in print, since there is evidence of incompleteness
in the known copies. In the spaces, with artistic borders,
which had been designed for inscriptions, nothing appears,
and in but two of the four cartouches evidently intended for
portraits do such portraits appear, viz., that of Ptolemy
and of the author himself.</p>

<p>The geographical outlines of the map closely resemble those
of De Mongenet, as well as those of Mercator. North America
is given practically the same shape. The great expanse of
ocean lying between this continent and Asia is called
&#8220;Oceanus orientalis indicus,&#8221; and midway between the
continents, in latitude 45 degrees, is &#8220;Sipango.&#8221; North
America is called &#8220;Americae,&#8221; also &#8220;Hispania maior,&#8221; while
South America is likewise called &#8220;Americae.&#8221; The great
austral land is represented but is unnamed. The whole is
indeed a fine example of Italian copper engraving.</p>

<p>Numerous copies of Florianus&#8217; map are known. It usually
appears in the Lafreri collection, and Fiorini notes that
copies may be found in the Archivo di State of Turin, in the
Marciana of Venice, in the Biblioteca Vittorio Emanuele of
Rome, in the Biblioteca Comunale of Treviso, in the private
library of Professor Marinelli of Florence, in the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>British Museum, in the
private library of Nordenski&ouml;ld. To the above may be
added the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress,
and the Harvard Library, which likewise possess copies.</p>

<p>Among the numerous references appearing here and there in
the literature of Italy, assuring us of the interest in that
country in globe construction, reference may be made to the
record left by Alessandro Piccolomini, a native of Siena,
and author of a work on the extent of the land and water,<a
name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> who, in the preparation
of his work, made extensive study of the records to be found
in plane maps and globes. In his work published in Venice in
the year 1558, though his dedication to M. Jacomo Cocco,
Archbishop of Corfu, reads August 28, 1557, &#8220;Della mia casa
di S. Giorgio, di Siena, il di XXVIII di Agosto MDLVII,&#8221; he
tells of several globes which it had been his privilege to
examine. &#8220;I have zealously examined geographical maps, both
plain and spherical, and especially those which are reputed
to be most faithful, for example, among others, a solid
terrestrial sphere shown me by Cardinal Viseo.<a
name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a
href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> Another I saw at
the home of the Cardinal of Carpi,<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301"
class="fnanchor">301</a> exhibiting mountain elevations in a
new and excellent manner, and still another much larger kept
at present at the home of Cardinal of Urbino.<a
name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a
href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> There is also a
globe having a diameter of about an arm&#8217;s length, which I
saw two years since at the home of the Archbishop of Corfu,
and still another I have recently seen about the same size
or about one arm&#8217;s length in diameter, which had been
presented to His Excellency the Duke of Paliano.&#8221; He adds
that he had made careful geographical computations in his
investigations, employing the last-named sphere. As to his
method of procedure in his studies he states that &#8220;first of
all having placed before me a solid sphere of about three
feet in diameter, the most exact I have been able to find
among those referred to above, namely, the one with the
equinoctial circle and with the meridian passing through the
Canaries of the Fortunate islands where Ptolemy located the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>prime meridian, I have divided it into four equal
parts&mdash;two northern and two southern.&#8221; It seems
probable that the globe here referred to is that which he
stated belonged to the Cardinal of Urbino, and which he
noted was larger than was that belonging to Cardinal Viseo
or to the Cardinal of Carpi, the diameter of which he stated
to be an arm&#8217;s length. Piccolomini gives us no intimation as
to the authorship of the five globes he says he examined. He
adds an interesting word concerning the character of the
globe of Cardinal Carpi, seeming to imply that it was not a
printed globe, since it represented &#8220;mountain elevations.&#8221;
We perhaps are justified, says Fiorini, in concluding from
this and other evidence that the maps on these globes were
not printed, since they were of very large size, and we know
that Mercator&#8217;s globes 41 cm. in diameter were then
considered to have special value because larger than others
constructed in a similar manner, that is, having their maps
engraved or printed.</p>

<p>We may here again refer to Ruscelli&#8217;s directions for globe
construction,<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> to which he added certain suggestions for
globe adornment, that they might appeal to princes and
nobles. &#8220;Globes of copper, bronze or silver,&#8221; he says, &#8220;such
as princes would desire to possess, to be fine, durable and
rare should be plated, that is, the circles, the letters,
the outlines of the countries should first be engraved and
then there should be added gold or silver plating.&#8221; &#8220;A
generous prince,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;could have them made in Asimino
or Tausia style, as they say, that is, have the copper
surface engraved, and the grooves filled with silver or gold
thread. By forcing this in the work can be made very
strong.&#8221; He states in one of his chapters that globes so
constructed are usually small, but he adds that he had seen
globes three and a half palms in diameter, such as that sent
to him by Zurelio Porcelaga. Of this last he speaks in words
of praise, passing on to refer to two large ones then under
construction in Venice. &#8220;One of these,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is of
copper being <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>made by Giulio Sanuto, which it is hoped
will be one of the best as one of the most beautiful of any
constructed up to the present time.&#8221; The implication seems
to be, from the words of Ruscelli, that at least some part
of the printing was to be made directly on the surface of
the sphere. Further information given by Ruscelli touching
Sanuto and Gonzaga in this connection is here of interest.
He states &#8220;besides the fact that Giulio Sanuto is very
skilful in drawing and engraving, especially in geographical
maps of the world and its parts, he is, in this task, being
aided by Livio Sanuto,<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> a Venetian nobleman, his brother,
among whose many good qualities he possesses to a degree
above the ordinary, are his attainments in the profession of
geography. Both are giving so much attention to this globe
that it is expected, in both matter and form, it will be
perfect. Another globe three arm&#8217;s length in diameter has,
since last year, been begun by Curtio Gonzaga, which he
intends shall contain all of those things that Taisnero has
included in his globe as well as many other things that the
said gentleman intends to add, hoping to make one of the
most beautiful and perfect spheres to be seen for many years
to come. This can easily be believed, for he will do
everything himself, and as the greater diligence will thus
be exercised we will have all of the advantages of his great
knowledge of geography, to which subject as ever, he is
giving all of his attention, and the advantage of his great
skill in lettering and designing.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></p>

<p>Ruscelli maintained that globes are preferable to ordinary
maps in geographical studies, stating that &#8220;although maps of
three or four arm&#8217;s length and width are to be found they
are not numerous and are not of great value, and furthermore
we have globes, which, in extent of space exhibited, surpass
them. Granting that some Princes and certain others do have
maps very large, as for example, such as Pope Paul II had
made for the palace of S. Marco in Rome, there are also
Princes and private persons who have globes which in size
much surpass the plane maps that I <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>have ever seen or
heard of.&#8221; &#8220;Until a few years since no one knew how to print
such globes, and all were made with pen and brush, ... later
geniuses have found a way for printing globe maps very
accurately, which, in a wonderful way they can place over
the surface of a sphere; a way has also been found for
making the spheres round and exact, and a method for
computing measurements for the coverings to fit the sphere,
and for the construction of such other things as belong
thereto.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></p>

<p>The Volpaja family of Florence achieved considerable
distinction in the late fifteenth and in the sixteenth
century, through those members who were interested in the
construction of astronomical instruments and particularly in
armillary spheres. Vasari tells us that &#8220;in the chapel of
Santa Trinita, in fresco, is a picture of the Magnificent
Lorenzo de&#8217; Medici, father of Pope Leo X.... In the same
picture is Lorenzo della Volpaja, a most excellent master in
the art of making watches, and a distinguished astrologer,
by whom a most beautiful clock was made for Lorenzo de&#8217;
Medici, which the most illustrious Duke Cosimo now has in
his palace, and wherein all of the movements of the planets
are perpetually shown by means of wheels, a very rare thing,
and the first that was made in that manner.&#8221;<a name=
"FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></p>

<p>At the time of its founding there came to the Museo di
Strumenti Antichi di Astronomia e di Fisica of Florence a
fine armillary sphere inscribed &#8220;Hieronimus Camilli
Vulpariae Florent: fe: 1557.&#8221; It is of gilded metal, having
five spheres or rings ranging from 60 to 75 mm. in diameter,
and in addition eighteen circles, including polar, tropical,
and equatorial circles with meridian and horizon, the latter
having a diameter of 144 mm. Further information recorded by
Fiorini tells us that it is mounted on a wooden base.<a
name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a
href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> On the equatorial
circle of the smallest sphere is engraved &#8220;Deferens Augiem,&#8221;
on the next, &#8220;Deferens Epiciculum,&#8221; on the third, &#8220;Deferens
Augiem,&#8221; on the fourth, &#8220;Deferens Dragonem.&#8221; The fifth
sphere is composed of six large circles <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156"
id="Page_156">156</a></span>and four small ones. The circles which
represent the meridians, the equator, the ecliptic, and the
horizon are graduated, while on the ecliptic appear the
names of the twelve zodiacal constellations, and on the
horizon the names of the principal winds or directions. This
globe is referred to as one of special interest because of
its peculiar and somewhat complicated construction; it is
mounted on a wooden base, which is more modern than the
globe proper, and in many parts gives evidence of
restoration.</p>

<p>In the same museum there is a second armillary sphere
constructed by a member of the Volpaja family, perhaps by
the same one who constructed the preceding. It is inscribed
&#8220;Hieronimus Vulpariae Florentius Fe. A.D.MDLXIIII&#8221; and was a
gift to the museum by the Grand Duke Leopold I. The diameter
of its horizon circle, including the attached parts, is 41
cm., and its height, including its base, 76 cm. It has been
described as follows: &#8220;An armillary sphere, the armillae of
which are of gilded brass. The small globe within the
circles representing the earth is of the clearest crystal.
The horizon is of gilded brass and rests on a branched
support ornamented with human heads in relief. The lower
part of the branches is attached to a base resting on three
lion&#8217;s paws. The branches, the heads, the base, and the paws
are all of brass. In the northern and southern sections of
the horizon there are attachments containing receptacles for
holding the magnetic needle, but which needle in both places
is wanting. The equator, the tropics, and the polar circles
are not zones but are triangular prisms bent in the form of
circles. Furthermore a part of the ecliptic, that is to say,
one of its zones, is of gilded brass and is graduated, and
shows the names of the months and the signs of the zodiac.
The diameter of the sphere is 12.6 pollici (inches?).&#8221;<a

<p>There is to be found in the Mathematical Salon of Dresden a
fine example of the work of Christian Heyden (1525-1576),
son of a rector of the St. Sebaldus School of N&uuml;rnberg.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>Doppelmayr<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> tells us that after years of study in
Leipzig and Wittenberg, he returned to his native city,
became interested in making mathematical instruments, and in
1564 he was appointed to a professorship of mathematics in
the famous N&uuml;rnberg gymnasium. His biographer does not
refer to his activity as a globe maker, but tells us that
about the year 1570 he constructed for the Emperor
Maximilian II a mechanical device for illustrating the
movement of the sun and the moon, which instrument, he
notes, especially interested the noted Frenchman, Petrus
Ramus, who carefully examined it on the occasion of a visit
to N&uuml;rnberg. The Dresden example of his work (Fig. <a href="#f67">67</a>),
the only example known, consists of a brass celestial globe
encased in a covering of brass, on the surface of which is
engraved a terrestrial map.&nbsp;It has a diameter of 72
cm., the whole being furnished with a horizon, a meridian,
and an hour circle. This is indeed a choice specimen of a
sixteenth-century engraved metal globe, of which we have
numerous examples, but it is rather an ornamental piece than
one of great scientific value.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;67. Globe of Christian Heyden, 1560.</p> </div>

<p>Doppelmayr likewise gives us a brief biographical note
referring to one Johannes Praetorius, a globe maker, born at
Joachimsthal in the year 1537.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> After a considerable
period of study, chiefly at Wittenberg, where he turned his
attention to the philosophical and mathematical sciences, he
took up a residence in N&uuml;rnberg in the year 1562. Here
he became interested in the construction of mechanical and
astronomical instruments, and soon won the favor of the
Emperor Maximilian II, which favor he enjoyed to the end of
that Emperor&#8217;s reign. It was about the year 1576 that he
became a professor of mathematics at Altdorf, where he died
in the year 1616. Doppelmayr refers to a number of the
mathematical and astronomical instruments constructed by
him, noting that in the year 1566 he completed two globes of
metal richly gilded, each having a diameter of 11&frac14;
inches, that each was furnished with an hour circle, a
movable <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>quadrant and semicircles, and that a compass was
set in the base of each. We learn also from the same
biographer that in the year 1568 he completed a brass
astrolabe having a diameter of &#8220;one schuh&#8221; (foot?), three
and one half inches, and that it was supplied with all parts
essential to a complete apparatus of its character. We are
further informed that shortly after the beginning of his
career in Altdorf he undertook the construction of a large
celestial globe of wood and paper, having a diameter of four
N&uuml;rnberg feet, that he was assisted in this work by the
artist and draughtsman, Christopher Heinrichs, and that on
the surface of the sphere one thousand six hundred and fifty
stars were indicated with appropriate accompanying
inscriptions.</p>

<p>Two pairs of Praetorius&#8217; globes are now known, one pair in
the Mathematical Salon of Dresden (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f68">68</a>),<a name=
"FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> and the other in the
Germanisches National Museum of N&uuml;rnberg. These globes
are of brass, each having a diameter of 28 cm.; each is
supplied with meridian, horizon, and hour circles and rests
on a tripod base. They are richly engraved pieces, the
terrestrial example being remarkably well preserved, the
celestial being slightly injured, through rubbing which has
removed parts of certain figures of the constellations.</p>

<p>Among those Italians who, in the sixteenth century, acquired
well-merited fame as globe makers may be mentioned Ignazio
Danti (1536-1586),<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> known as Pellegrino before he entered
the order of the preaching friars in his nineteenth year.
The name Danti appears to have been given him chiefly on
account of his great learning, particularly in the field of
mathematics and astronomy. In the same branches of science
his father had achieved distinction, and likewise his
grandfather, Vicenzo de Rinaldi, who, in the year 1571,
issued a translation of the &#8216;Sfera&#8217; of Sacrobosco, and who
constructed, as we are told, an astrolabe and an armillary
sphere.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> It seems to have been early in the year 1563 that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>Danti was called to Florence by Duke Cosimo for the
purpose of constructing, under his patronage, nautical and
astronomical instruments and geographical maps. Of his work
which is still known to us there may be first mentioned an
astronomical quadrant placed on the fa&ccedil;ade of the
church of Santa Maria Novella, and an equinoctial armilla
placed within the same church. We have first mention in
Vasari&#8217;s &#8216;Lives&#8217; of the globe and map work of his which
especially concerns us here. It is an interesting account of
his activity in this field, an account worthy of citation.
&#8220;Fra Ignazio Danti is very learned in cosmography and a man
of distinguished ability in letters, in so much that the
Duke Cosimo has committed to his care a work than which none
more perfect in design, or more important in the results to
be expected from it, has ever been executed in that kind.
His excellency has caused a room of considerable extent to
be prepared on the second floor of his palace, as a
continuation of, and an addition to the guardaroba; around
this room he has had cabinets arranged seven braccia high,
and richly carved in walnut wood, intending to place within
them the most valuable and beautiful works of art in his
possession; and on the doors of the same he has caused
fifty-seven pictures, about two braccia in height and of
proportionate width, to be painted in oil on wood in the
manner of miniatures. The subjects delineated are the
Ptolemaic Tables, measured by Don Ignazio with the most
exact perfection, and corrected according to the latest
authorities; sea-charts of the utmost accuracy are added,
the scale and the degrees being adjusted with all possible
care, and all having the ancient, as well as the modern,
names; the division made of these works being as follows. At
the principal entrance into the room are seen four pictures
executed on the sides of the cabinets, and representing in
perspective the halves of four spheres, those below showing
the earth, and those above the heavens with all their signs
and celestial figures. Proceeding toward the right we have
all Europe depicted in fourteen compartments, the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>pictures succeeding each
other to the center of the wall which is at the head of the
room, and opposite to the principal door, that namely
whereon is placed the horologue with its wheels, and the
daily motions made by the planets in their spheres; I mean
that so much renowned clock made by the Florentine Lorenzo
della Volpaja. Above the compartments representing Europe,
are those of Africa in eleven divisions; these extend to the
horologue itself, beyond which and on the lower part is
Asia, which occupies a consecutive range of four
compartments, extending to the principal door. There are
besides the West Indies, which commence from the clock, and
continue to the principal door; the whole series forming the
fifty-seven divisions before mentioned. On the lower part of
the walls and immediately beneath the geographical
delineations, in an equal number of compartments will be the
various plants and animals produced by the respective
countries, all depicted from nature. Over the cornice of the
said cabinets, which completes the decorations, there are to
be niches dividing the pictures, and in these will be placed
certain antique busts in marble, representing the Emperors
and Princes by whom these lands have been possessed, so far
as those portraits are known to exist or can be procured.
The ceiling is entirely in carved wood-work, and within the
compartments of the same are twelve large pictures, in each
of which are to be four celestial signs, making in the whole
forty-eight; the figures are to be but little less than life
size, each accompanied by its stars. On the walls beneath
are three hundred portraits of distinguished persons
belonging to the last five centuries, or somewhat more; they
are painted in oil; but, that I may not make too long a
story, I refer the mention of their names to the tables of
my work. All have frames of similar size, very richly carved
in oak, and producing an exceedingly fine effect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the two pictures occupying the center of the ceiling,
each of which is four braccia wide, are the celestial signs;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>these can be thrown back by means which cannot be
perceived; and in a space representing the concave are to be
two large spheres, one representing the earth: this will be
made to descend by a concealed windlass, and will then be
balanced on a support adequate to that purpose, so that when
fixed, all the pictures and the maps on the cabinet will be
reflected therein, each part being thus readily found on the
sphere. On the other globe the forty-eight celestial signs
will be arranged, in such sort that all the operations of
the astrolabe may be performed most perfectly by the aid
thereof. The plan of this work has proceeded from the Duke
Cosimo, who desired to have all these parts of the earth and
heaven brought for once fairly together in their just
positions, exactly and without errors, to the end that they
might be observed and measured, either apart or all
together, as might be desired by those who study and delight
in this most beautiful science. I have therefore thought
myself bound to make a memorial of the same in this place,
for the sake of Fra Ignazio; and that his ability, with the
magnificence of that great Prince, who has judged us worthy
to enjoy the benefits of so honorable a labor, may be made
known to all the world.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></p>

<p>Danti must have undertaken this great work shortly after his
arrival in Florence, since one of his maps, to which Vasari
refers, is dated 1563, and it appears that the terrestrial
globe must have been finished by 1567, since the general
Depositaria of that year, as cited by Badia, records that
twenty lire were paid to the gold-leaf maker, Taddeo di
Francesco, for the five hundred leaves of gold to be used
for the globe, and there is no succeeding entry referring to
this particular piece of work.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> We know that he never
completed the task which had been assigned to him. Duke
Cosimo&#8217;s death occurred in the year 1575, and his son and
successor, Francesco, manifested but little interest in
furthering the cause of science. It was perhaps at the
instance of Francesco that the general of the Dominican
Order <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>directed Danti to leave Florence, and he passed the
remainder of his days in Bologna. Apparently but thirty of
the fifty-seven maps which were to be made by Danti were
completed at the time of his dismissal, and only the
terrestrial globe. As evidence that he did not construct the
celestial globe, Badia cites a letter written by Antonio
Lupicini to the Grand Duke Ferdinand, dated October 27,
1587. After reference to certain great works planned by
Cosimo in the last years of his life, such as those referred
to by Vasari, he adds that &#8220;when it seemed that nothing else
was to be seen in the room, at a certain sign these
historical representations disappeared and the cosmography
of the whole mechanism, constructed after the manner of
Ptolemy, was uncovered; in doing so they opened the ceiling
and let down the representations of the planets, resting
them on a stand which came out of the floor, and from the
floor also appeared a terrestrial and a celestial globe each
three and a half braccia in diameter, one of which had been
made by Fra Ignazio, and the model of which I myself
have.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> The terrestrial globe, at first placed in the room
for which it was intended, was later removed to the gallery,
where on account of much handling it was greatly injured,
and in the year 1595 the cosmographer, Antonio Santucci, was
entrusted with its restoration.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318"
class="fnanchor">318</a> Admired as it has been for more than
three hundred years, on account of its size and excellent
workmanship, repeatedly handled through all these years by
careless visitors, a second restoration was undertaken a few
years since by Ferdinando Meucci, director of the museum to
which it finally passed. Meucci directed this work with
great care, studying minutely the construction of the globe
under the opportunity thus offered. Fiorini, citing
information especially given him by Meucci,<a
name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a
href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> says that the
diameter of this globe is 2.04 m.; that the ball is of wood
having a papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; covering, protected
without by a wrapping of cord and metal plates, and that it
is very substantially braced within. Danti himself in
describing the construction <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>of the globe, on receiving
an order for a similar one, says that &#8220;the surface of this
globe is thirty-six square braccia and it is supported
within by an iron frame, as a globe of this size would not
stand without bracing; it represents a new invention by
means of which, though large, it can be moved in every
direction with a single finger, and its pole can be easily
elevated or depressed.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> These Medici globes, it seems,
attracted much attention, and not alone in Italy. Pontanus,
in the preface of his edition of Hues&#8217; &#8216;Tractatus de
Globis,&#8217; after a reference to the celestial globe of Tycho
Brahe, six feet in diameter, adds that Ferdinand I of
Tuscany possessed two globes, one terrestrial and the other
an armillary sphere with circles and orbs, and that these
globes were constructed by the same hand.<a name=
"FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> This last statement we
now know to be an error, since the terrestrial globe alone
was the work of Ignazio Danti, the armillary sphere being
the work of Antonio Santucci.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Nationale of Turin possesses a unique and
highly interesting globe signed &#8220;Franciscus Bassus
Mediolanensis feccit 1570,&#8221; called Basso in his day,
although his name appears to have been Francesco Pelliccioni
or Pilizzoni.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> In this we have one of the finest examples
of the style of constructing and ornamenting metal globes,
described by Ruscelli as <i>agemina</i>, in which gold and silver
threads and plates are forced into the engraved outlines on
the surface of the ball.</p>

<p>The globe, a hollow iron sphere about 56 cm. in diameter, is
in an excellent state of preservation. The engraved
parallels and meridians are indicated at intervals of ten
degrees, the prime meridian passing through the Canary
Islands. It has thus been described by the librarian,
Francesco Carta:<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> &#8220;The parts of the globe in gold are the
equator, the tropics, the polar circles and many mountain
chains; the known and the unknown polar regions are flaked
with gold. In gold are the crowns which designate the
several kingdoms, the small islands and the graduated prime
meridian. In gold and silver <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>are the ships which sail the
seas, the smaller being entirely of gold. The ecliptic, the
meridians excepting the prime meridian, the parallels, the
majority of the mountain chains of the unknown lands, the
rivers, as well as the outlines of the lands and the seas.
On the graduated horizon circle are the Latin names of the
winds in silver capital letters. These are the twelve winds
of Timostene. A graduated metal meridian passes through the
poles and is attached to the rational horizon which is
supported by four small pyramidal columns having
quadrangular bases. At the top, and fastened to the
framework of the globe with a silver ribbon, is a silver
heart having extended wings, the feathers of which are of
gold and silver. From this heart rises a small gilded design
representing an olive branch, having leaves of gold. From
the lower part of the support hang silver ribbons flaked
with gold.&#8221; Practically all inscriptions are in silver
capital letters, the majority being in Latin, but a few are
in Italian and in Spanish. To North America which is
connected with Asia, in accord with the idea so prevalent in
the second quarter of the century, is given the name &#8220;Asia
magna quae India borealis,&#8221; and to South America the name
&#8220;America Nova.&#8221; In addition to the above inscriptions we
find such as &#8220;Hispania Major,&#8221; &#8220;G. d. Anian,&#8221; &#8220;Oceanus
Indicus,&#8221; &#8220;Sinus Magnus Aphricae.&#8221; In Brazil is the
inscription, &#8220;His Leoni Copia.&#8221; The inscription &#8220;Terra
Australis recenter inventa anno 1499, sed nondum plene
cognita terra,&#8221; closely resembles an inscription similarly
placed on the world map of Orontius Finaeus of 1531, which
reads &#8220;Terra Australis recenter inventa sed nondum plene
cognita.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> It does not appear that great scientific value
attaches to this globe, since there clearly was no attempt
to produce a terrestrial map to date. It, however, is a most
interesting example of globe construction in a day when
globes were so much in favor.</p>

<p>The Lancisiana Biblioteca of Rome possesses an artistically
constructed armillary sphere, apparently the work of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>Giovanni Maria Barrocci,
who, in the second half of the sixteenth century, achieved
distinction as a maker of watches and of mathematical
instruments. Fiorini gives reason for thinking this to be of
about the year 1570, as well as reason for attributing the
work to Barrocci,<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> finding it in an epitaph of a member of
the family in which there is allusion to the construction of
a celestial globe for Pope Pius V.</p>

<p>Two globes, one celestial attributed to Hieronymo de
Boncompagni, and one terrestrial attributed to Emanuele
Filiberto and probably constructed about the year 1570, are
briefly referred to by Fiorini as belonging to the
Osservatorio del Collegio Romano.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326"
class="fnanchor">326</a> Further reference to these globes has
not been obtainable, there being no mention of the same in a
communication received by the author from this observatory.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Nationale Vittorio Emanuele of Rome possesses
two remarkably fine manuscript globes, a terrestrial and a
celestial, the latter bearing the inscription &#8220;Anno Jobel<a
name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> 1575 ad que supputatae
sunt stellae.&#8221; &#8220;In the Jubilee year for which the positions
of the stars have been computed.&#8221; While not giving with
certainty the exact date of their construction, it seems
that it could not have been later than that given in the
legend. The globes bear the coat of arms of the Jesuits,
which may only suggest that the maker was a member of that
order. Each of these globes, or globe balls, is constructed
of a wooden framework, covered with a preparation of
plaster, over which has been added a coat of thick varnish.
On the surface thus prepared the map has been drawn and
painted in colors. Each has a diameter of about 70 cm., is
mounted on a pyramidal base, 77 cm. in height, from which
rises a rod 45 cm. in length, supporting two semicircles
which serve as a direct base support for the iron horizon
circle. The celestial globe has represented on its surface
the equator, the tropics, the polar circles, the colures,
the ecliptic, and the zodiac, and the figures representing
the several constellations. These figures are very <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>artistically painted, having their
several names written in gold in the Latin language; some
figures and names unfortunately are wanting by reason of
injury to the surface of the globe. On the terrestrial globe
the equator, the tropics, and the polar circles are
represented, while but two meridians are indicated, the
prime meridian passing through the Canary Islands while the
other has been drawn ninety degrees from this, that is, cuts
it at right angles at the poles.</p>

<p>The Biblioteca Laurentiana of Florence possesses four small
armillary spheres, bearing neither date nor author
legends.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> The larger of these has a diameter of about 32
cm., is of brass, and rests upon an artistic support
composed of a group of bronze satyrs. The other three, by
reason of their close resemblance, appear to be the work of
the same artist. Each has a diameter of about 23 cm. and a
base of brass on which stands a small bronze statue, which
bears on its shoulders a globe. This globe supports the
several circles composing the armillary sphere. The
supporting statue in one of these is clad and is represented
as wearing sandals on the feet, supposedly representing the
mythical Atlas. In another of these the statue is that of a
man resting on the right knee with the left hand uplifted,
while in the third the statue is that of a woman resting
upon the left knee, having the right hand uplifted. These
globes are reported as not being in good condition, but each
exhibits artistic merit of a high order.</p>

<p>There is likewise to be found in the Biblioteca Nationale of
Florence a small celestial globe of bronze, and a celestial
and terrestrial globe of silver. These globes are neither
signed nor dated but are thought to belong to the period now
under consideration. The bronze globe has the constellations
represented in relief. It is exceedingly small, having a
diameter of about 10 cm. The silver globes have diameters
about half the preceding, or about 4.5 cm. They are
furnished with horizon and meridian circles, and have
mountings which clearly are modern. The several
constellations <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>represented on the celestial globe are
exceedingly well done, as are all of the decorative figures
appearing on the terrestrial globe. Geographical names are
necessarily few because of the size of the globe.</p>

<p>Attention has been called to the references which Ruscelli
makes in his &#8216;Geografia&#8217; to globe construction.<a name=
"FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> Notice may likewise
here be called to a similar reference, though much more
brief, made by Francesco Maurolico, a native of Messina, and
often referred to as the new Archimedes, because of his
great fame acquired in the field of mathematics and
astronomy. In his work, published in the year 1575,<a
name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a
href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> he devoted part
of one chapter to the subject &#8220;De sphaera solida,&#8221;
describing the construction of a celestial globe, and the
use of the same. We have no evidence that he was ever
engaged in the construction of such instruments as aids in
the study of his science.</p>

<p>Lastly, in this chapter, mention may be made of the work of
Mario Cartaro. It appears that with his work that of the
Italian globe makers of the century practically came to a
close; the names of but two or three appear in the last
quarter.</p>

<p>Cartaro first achieved distinction as a designer and
engraver in Rome, where he issued a work containing the
portraits of the first twenty-four Roman Emperors.<a
name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a
href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> From Rome it
appears that he went to Naples, where he continued to reside
until the time of his death. That he was much favored in
Naples is attested by the fact that he was given a
commission to design or to represent all places and plants
in the kingdom, and to receive for the same &#8220;ten scudi per
month.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> It is probable that as a result of this
commission we have that fine manuscript atlas of thirteen
maps now belonging to the Biblioteca Nationale of Naples,
representing the provinces of the kingdom and signed &#8220;M.
Cartaro F. 1613.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> This manuscript gives striking evidence
of his cartographical ability. The manuscript is of paper,
its first map representing the ancient kingdom of Naples, on
which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>is placed the Spanish coat of arms. The remaining
twelve represent the following named provinces: Terra di
Lavorro, Principato Citra, Principato Ultra, Basilicata,
Calabria Citra, Calabria Ultra, Terra d&#8217;Otranto, Terra di
Bari, Capitanata, Contado di Molise, Abruzzo Citra, Abruzzo
Ultra.</p>

<p>Cartaro&#8217;s globes are of solid wood about 16 cm. in diameter,
the balls being covered with engraved gore maps. On his
celestial globes appears the inscription, &#8220;Marius Cartarus
Viterbensis Autor incidebat Romae c&#361; priv. 1577.&#8221; The
twelve or rather twenty-four half gores, since they are cut
on the line of the ecliptic, are copper engraved. The
equator, the tropics, the polar circles, and the colures are
represented, the ecliptic and the equator being graduated,
the degrees being alternately colored red and yellow. The
several constellations are well drawn, are colored yellow
with shading, and stand out prominently against a blue
background representing the sky. His terrestrial globes bear
the inscription &#8220;Marius Cartarus Viterbensis Autor incidebat
Romae MDLXXVII cum privilegio,&#8221; the gores being divided, as
in the preceding, into twenty-four. Meridians and parallels
are drawn at intervals of fifteen degrees, alternate degrees
being colored red and yellow, the prime meridian passing
through the Canary Islands and being graduated. In the
Osservatorio del Collegio Romano may be found two copies of
the celestial and one example of the terrestrial globe, one
of the former once belonging to the astronomer, Virgilio
Spada, and later to the Biblioteca Vallicelliana. Neither of
these globes is well preserved, the original mountings are
wanting, and each rests on a base of wood which has been
merely designed to serve as a support.</p>

<p>A copy of the celestial globe may be found in the Museo di
Strumenti Antichi of Florence, which was presented to the
museum by the Grand Duke Leopold I. This example is reported
to be in good condition, being mounted on a base of wood,
and having a horizon and a meridian circle of wood, both of
which are graduated. On the horizon appear the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>names of the eight
principal winds, with representations of the wind heads
having distended cheeks.</p>

<p>A fairly well-preserved example of the terrestrial globe
(Fig. <a href="#f69">69</a>) was recently purchased by Mr. Reed of New York
City, by whose courteous permission it was photographed for
reproduction in this work. It has a single pedestal base
which is gilded, is furnished with horizon and meridian
circles, the former being supported by two semicircles,
which in turn rest on the pedestal base. Practically all of
the inscriptions are in capitals, and all of the work of the
engraver has been very artistically done. The outline of the
New World resembles closely that given by Mercator and by
Zaltiari. In North America we find interestingly represented
a great lake drained by two rivers, apparently, but not
accurately drawn as the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence.
The southwestern part is called &#8220;Nova Spagna,&#8221; Mexico is
designated as &#8220;Nova Galitia&#8221;; in the northeast we find &#8220;La
Nova Franza,&#8221; and &#8220;Terra de Nor&#361;beca,&#8221; and in the
southeast &#8220;Florida,&#8221; although the peninsula is not well
drawn. South America bears the name &#8220;America,&#8221; so drawn as
practically to cover the continent, and in addition we find
&#8220;Castiglia de Loro,&#8221; &#8220;Para,&#8221; &#8220;Peru Provin,&#8221; &#8220;Chili,&#8221; and
lake &#8220;Tichia,&#8221; located well inland. It will be noted in the
reproduction that the sphere is well shot through by the
industrious book- or woodworm.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><b>N</b> the last three chapters attention has been called to the
globes and globe makers of the earlier years of the
sixteenth century, special mention having been made in
Chapters VI and VII of the notions entertained concerning
the geography of the New World as exhibited in the
terrestrial globe maps. In the first quarter of the century,
as was stated, the newly discovered lands were represented
as having no geographical connection with the Old World, and
with few exceptions the two continents of the western
hemisphere were separated from each other either by a strait
or by a wide expanse of ocean. In the second quarter of the
century the belief seemed to have found very general
acceptance that the New World was but a prolongation or
eastward extension of the Asiatic continent, a belief which
found expression in the plane as well as in the globe maps.
Exceptions to such belief were likewise noted, as was also
the inclination manifesting itself in this second quarter to
return <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>to the earlier notions, that a great body of
water separated Asia from the northern continent, in the
spread of which notion Mercator seems to have exerted a
dominating influence. In the third quarter of the century
the globe maps indicate that a belief in the independent
position of the New World had again found very general
acceptance, although there appeared now and then an
expression in the maps that the theory of an Asiatic
connection still lingered. In this third quarter it was the
Italian globe makers who were the most active, yet it must
be admitted that the majority of the globes produced in
these years in the peninsula were not of striking
importance. In the literature of the period, references to
globes which were constructed, and which appear to have been
well known, are not infrequent, but one is inclined to a
belief, based upon these references, and upon those globes
which are extant, that time has destroyed the best of them.</p>

<p>The records of the last quarter of the century, of which we
come now to speak in this chapter, seem to show a decline of
interest in globe making among the Italians, the examples of
their work left to us being exceedingly few. We note a
rising interest and activity in globe making in the North in
this period, which reaches a climax during the early years
of the seventeenth century in the splendid work given out by
the great masters of the Netherlands. A well-merited fame
especially crowns the labors of members of the Van Langren,
the Blaeu, and the Hondius families.<a name="FNanchor_334"
id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></p>

<p>Although remembered chiefly for his part in the construction
of the famous Strassburg cathedral clock, Conrad Dasypodius
(1530-1600) can also claim a place among the globe makers of
his day, that is, of the period we now have under
consideration.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> He was the son of Petrus Dasypodius, a
native of Frauenfeld in Switzerland, whose name originally
was Rauhfuss or Hasenfuss, and who for some years held a
position as professor of the Greek language in Z&uuml;rich.
In the year 1530 he removed to Strassburg to accept a
similar <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>position in the Strassburg Academy, where he died
in the year 1559. Young Conrad, after an association for a
period with the then famous Strassburg mathematician,
Christian Herlin,<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> as his favorite pupil, traveled
extensively, going to Paris and later to Lyons, where he
continued his mathematical studies. In October, 1562, he
became the successor of Herlin, and in the year 1563 canon
of St. Thomas. To the impulse which he contributed to
mathematical studies is due the high place held for a
considerable period by the Strassburg Academy.<a
name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a
href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> It is a part of
his great service that he not only encouraged the study of
the Greek mathematicians, but he also was especially
interested in having their works brought to the attention of
the public through their reissue, especially the works of
Euclid. The list of Dasypodius&#8217; publications<a name=
"FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> is a long one and is
such as to place him among the foremost scholars of his day,
but it was, however, his astronomical clock, noted above,
which brought him special renown in the larger circles. It
was near the middle of the fourteenth century that the first
clock, which was of wood, was constructed for the cathedral,
but time had wrought its destructive work, and as early as
1547 a commission was appointed to consider the question of
its restoration, and of this commission Christian Herlin was
a prominent member. His death in the year 1562 left the plan
incomplete, and eight years passed before his pupil,
Dasypodius, was successful in urging the magistrates of the
city to take up the work anew. In the year 1570, through his
advice, two young globe makers of Schaffhausen, Isaac and
Josias Habrecht,<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> who had given aid to their father in the
construction of the &#8220;Frohnwaagthurm Uhr&#8221; of the last-named
city, together with the Schaffhausen artists, Tobias and
Josias Stimmer,<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> were invited to take up the work under
his supervision. At the end of three years the clock was
completed and soon came to be referred to as one of the
seven wonders of Germany. &#8220;Truly a masterpiece,&#8221; said
Montucla, &#8220;and the first of its kind in all Europe by reason
of the numerous <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>movements which it executes.&#8221;<a name=
"FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> In the year 1580 a
description of the same was prepared and published by
Dasypodius himself.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> Although calling for frequent repairs
the clock continued running until the year 1789, when it
ceased, and after fifty years had passed the old mechanism
was replaced by new, the work of Schwilgu&eacute;.<a
name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a
href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> Remarkable as is
the entire masterpiece, it is the globes with which
Dasypodius furnished it that especially interest us here. At
the base of the clock is placed a celestial sphere (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f70">70</a>) three feet in diameter, supported
by four columns of wood richly carved. On the surface appear
the forty-eight Ptolemaic constellations, each constellation
having its appropriate figure, and the 1022 stars which had
been located in Ptolemy&#8217;s day. The globe is so connected
with the machinery, by which the various parts of the clock
are made to perform their functions, that it makes one
revolution on its axis every twenty-four hours, thus
representing the rising and the setting of the several
celestial bodies. Two circles were added, one carrying the
sun and the other the moon, adjusted so as to turn about the
globe, the first in twenty-four hours, and the second in
about twenty-five. The arrangement of the movements, it
appears, was not greatly altered in the reconstruction of
1838-1842, and the clock, as it now stands, is thus
described by Britten: &#8220;On the floor level is a celestial
globe indicating siderial time. In its motion round its axis
the globe carries with it the circles that surround
it&mdash;namely, the equator, the ecliptic, the solstitial
and equinoctial colures, while the meridian and horizon
circles remain motionless, so that there are shown the
rising and the setting, as well as the passage over the
meridian of Strassburg, of all stars that are visible to the
naked eye, and which appear above the horizon. Behind the
celestial globe is the calendar; on a metallic band, nine
inches wide and thirty feet in circumference, are the months
and the days of the months, Dominical letters, fixed and
movable feast days. The band is shifted at midnight, and a
statue of Apollo points out the day of the month and <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>the name of the saint corresponding to
that day. The internal part of the annular band indicates
true solar time, the rising and the setting of the sun, the
diurnal motion of the moon around the earth, and its passage
over the meridian, the phases of the moon and the eclipses
of the sun and moon. Adjacent compartments are devoted to a
perpetual calendar, solar and lunar cycles and other
periodic occurrences, solar and lunar equations, etc. Above
the calendar appear allegorical figures, seated in chariots,
and representing the days of the week. These chariots, drawn
by such animals as are assigned as attributes of the
divinities, run on a circular railway and appear each in
order. In the story above the globe is a planetarium in
which the revolutions of the planets are represented upon a
large dial plate, and above the planetarium, and upon a
star-decked sky, is a globe devoted to showing the phases of
the moon. In the second story of the clock has been placed a
terrestrial globe, which likewise is adjusted to revolve in
representation of the revolution of the earth.&#8221;<a

<p>Peter Apianus (Bienewitz or Bennewitz) (1495-1552) was a
native of Leisnig, Saxony.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> His earliest education was
received in the village of Roschlitz, but at the age of
twenty-three he entered the University of Leipzig, where it
appears that astronomy and mathematics chiefly claimed his
interest (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f71">71</a>). In 1527 he received and accepted an
appointment as professor of mathematics in the University of
Ingolstadt, and in 1541, for his distinguished abilities, he
was ennobled by the Emperor Charles V. In addition to the
fame acquired through his mathematical treatises he became
widely known as a maker of physical and astronomical
instruments, among which were celestial globes. Numerous as
appear to have been these globes of his construction, no
example at present is known bearing the unmistakable
evidence of his workmanship. Clemens, in his description of
the Library of the Escorial,<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> gives us to understand that
it possessed at one time one or more Peter Apianus globes,
which were probably <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>carried to Spain by the Emperor
himself. It seems probable that a diligent search through
public and private libraries and museums in that country
would lead to the discovery of some of his globes or
mathematical instruments.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;71. Portrait of Peter Apianus.</p> </div>

<p>Kepler tells us of an Apianus globe which he saw on a
journey from W&uuml;rtemberg to Gratz, noting that it was so
constructed that the stars could be removed at pleasure from
the sphere.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> Of this particular globe nothing seems now to
be known. It is thought hardly probable that the one
referred to by Kepler is that fine celestial Apianus globe
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f72">72</a>) belonging to the K. B. Hof- u. Staats
Bibliothek of Munich. There seems to be scarcely a doubt
that this, as its companion, a terrestrial globe, is the
work of the son Philip. Repeated inquiry has not resulted in
obtaining definite answer as to the dimensions of these
globes nor a description of such detailed features as would
here prove of interest. The photographic reproductions show
them to be of remarkably artistic workmanship.&nbsp;Each is
furnished with a heavy meridian circle, and with a similarly
designed horizon circle supported by a semicircle which
rests upon an elaborately constructed base.<a
name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a
href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> The history of
these globes seems not to be known, as stated above. We have
an inventory of the Herzoglich-Bayrische collection of
mathematical and astronomical instruments, prepared by the
Jesuit, Fickler, which contains, page 147, the following
entry relative to the globes to be found therein: &#8220;Folget
die Tafl. Nr. 34. Daraus stehen drey grosser hulzinen Globi
Coelestes, davon d. ain in einem messingen gestell, mit
ainem messingem zodiaco, der dritt von mettall. 1777. Sechs

"FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> &#8220;Next in order is table
No. 34. On this there stand three large celestial globes of
wood, one of which has a base of brass, with a brass horizon
circle, the third of metal, 1777. There are six large
terrestrial globes of wood, with metal horizon circles,
1778. Two small globes, one <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>celestial, the other
terrestrial, resting on turned wooden feet.&#8221; It will be
noted, however, that there is no mention therein of Apianus
globes. Kobalt tells us that Apianus &#8220;vertigte allerley
mathematische instrumente, als Cosmolabium, Globos duos
Caeli et Terrae maximos, und Planisphaerium,&#8221; &#8220;constructed
many kinds of mathematical instruments such as astrolabes,
two large globes celestial and terrestrial and
planispheres.&#8221; This same author gives us the information
that &#8220;in der k. b. Central-Bibliothek befinden sich zwei
grosse, von Apian ververtigte und von Johann Mielichs
gemalte Globi Coelestes et Terrestres, worauf folgende
Inschrift zo lesen ist, &#8216;Illustrss Seren. Principi ac Domino

large globes celestial and terrestrial constructed by
Apianus and painted by Johan M&uuml;elichs, on which is the
following inscription: &#8216;To the Most Illustrious, Most Serene
Prince and Lord D. Albert Count of the Rhenish Palatinate,
etc. His Most Clement Lord this celestial globe by his
command, fashioned according to the observations and
traditions of both ancient and modern historiographers
dedicates Philip Apianus in the year of Salvation 1576.&#8217;&#8221;<a
name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> It seems, therefore,
probable, from the above citation, that it was the son
Philip who constructed these Munich globes. It was in the
year 1552 that he followed his father as professor of
mathematics in the University of Ingolstadt and like his
father soon won distinction for himself as cartographer,
producing his famous Bayrische Landtafeln as his first work
of note. It seems further probable that shortly after this
work he became interested in globe construction, in which
line of activity he made for himself a place of first rank.</p>

<p>The celestial globe referred to above has represented on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>its surface the several Ptolemaic constellations,
exquisitely colored, and the stars have been given names in
Greek, Latin, and Arabic. The terrestrial globe map is
considerably injured, especially in the polar regions, but
the continental and other outlines are all clearly
traceable. Three large compass roses, of ornamental pattern,
are placed along the Line of Demarcation. The coast outline
of Europe is, in the main, well done, as is that of Africa
and the New World. The Nile and the Niger rivers no longer
find their source in the same common lake. The
representations of the far eastern regions indicate that
Apianus had a fairly good knowledge of the records of the
Holland explorers.</p>

<p>A fine example of the metal worker&#8217;s art of this period may
be found in a silvered bronze celestial globe (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f73">73</a>)
belonging to the Morgan collection recently placed in the
Metropolitan Museum of New York. On the meridian circle we
find the maker and date legend reading &#8220;Gerhard Emmoser,
sac. caes. meis horologiarius, F. Viennae 1579.&#8221; The sphere,
which can be opened on the line of the ecliptic, has a
diameter of about 13 cm. Within has been placed a delicately
constructed mechanism by means of which the sphere is made
to rotate once in twenty-four hours on its equatorial axis,
the key winding stem for this machinery projecting at the
north pole through an engraved hour plate with pointer. With
its meridian and its horizon circle it is adjusted to make
one revolution in three hundred and sixty-five days. A
stationary ring, about 2 cm. in width, which closely
surrounds the horizon circle and in its same plane, fits the
instrument as a calendar. This ring has engraved on its
surface crossing lines, one for each day of the year, to
each month there being assigned its proper number of days or
lines, as, for example, &#8220;October habet 31 dies,&#8221; &#8220;November
habet 30 dies.&#8221; As the sphere with its circles revolves, a
pointer attached to the horizon circle indicates on the
calendar ring each day of each month in succession. The
surface of the sphere is exquisitely engraved <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>with representations of
the several constellations, the name of each being given in
Latin. The instrument is made to rest upon the back of a
winged horse in silvered bronze, this in turn standing upon
an artistic circle base. It is well preserved and is a
choice example of such instruments, which in this period
were in particular favor.</p>

<p>Carlus Platus, a maker of metal globes in the last quarter
of the sixteenth century, is known to us through two fine
extant examples of his work.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> The first of these,
inscribed &#8220;Romae a. 1578 Car. Pl.,&#8221; may be found in the
Museo di Strumenti Antichi of Florence, having been added to
this collection by its former distinguished director, F.
Meucci. The horizon diameter of this armillary sphere is
about 21 cm. It has been described as one beautifully
constructed of brass and mounted on a carved wooden base.
The circle representing the course of the sun and that made
to represent the course of the moon are made to revolve on
the axis of the ecliptic, and a small ball, of recent
construction, representing the earth, is placed in the
common center of the armillae, and is made to revolve on the
axis of the equator. A dial attached to the axis of the
earth below the meridian circle marks the hours, which are
engraved on the Arctic polar circle. A few points marked on
the colures indicate the position of the principal stars.
All of the circles have been carefully graduated. On that
one representing the zodiac have been engraved the names of
the months and the pictures of the several zodiacal figures,
while on the horizon circle are the names of the principal
winds in Greek, Latin, and Italian.</p>

<p>A second globe of Platus, signed &#8220;Carolus Platus Romae Anno
1598,&#8221; may be found in the Biblioteca Barbarini of Rome. It
is composed of two hollow brass hemispheres, making a ball
14 cm. in diameter, which is surrounded by a brass meridian
and a brass horizon circle, the whole resting on a tripod
base. It is a fine example of an early metal <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>engraved globe, the
representation of the figures of the constellations in
particular being done in a very superior manner. On the
surface of the sphere the equator, the ecliptic, the
equinoctial, and the solstitial colures are represented. The
history of the globe seems not to be known, but it is
probable that it came to the Barbarini Palace in the time of
Pope Urban VIII, who, before filling his pontifical office,
was known as Maffeo Barbarini.</p>

<p>Of the celestial globes constructed by George Roll and
Joannes Reinhold three examples are known.<a
name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a
href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> One of these may
be found in the collection of the Mathematical Salon of
Dresden (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f74">74</a>) one in the Osservatorio di
Capodimonte of Naples and one in the K. K. Hofbibliothek in
Vienna. The Roll and Reinhold globe of the Dresden
collection, bearing the inscription &#8220;Georg Roll et Joannes
Reinhold elaborabant Augustae 1586,&#8221; is an exceedingly
interesting instrument, unique in the manner of its
construction and remarkably well preserved. It is of brass,
having a diameter of 36 cm., and is furnished with numerous
movable circles, a large meridian circle surmounted with an
armillary sphere, and a brass horizon circle on which are
marked the old and the new calendars, the names of the
twelve months and of the important holy days. The globe
base, very artistically wrought, rests upon four griffin&#8217;s
feet, between which a small terrestrial globe 10 cm. in
diameter has been placed, this having been furnished with
its own independent support. The large celestial sphere is
furnished with a clocklike mechanism by means of which it is
made to revolve in representation of the diurnal motion of
the heavens. According to existing records it was purchased
in the year 1593 by order of the Elector Christian II, and
by him was presented to the Academy of Arts of Dresden.
Zeiller tells us that this and the Heyden globe were those
&#8220;with which the Prince Elector Augustus was accustomed to
amuse himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>It has not been possible to obtain a description of the
Vienna globe. It appears that it was constructed in the year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>1588, and that, like the Dresden example, the celestial
sphere is made to revolve by means of clockwork.</p>

<p>The Roll and Reinhold globe belonging to the Osservatorio di
Capodimonte, according to Fiorini, is one especially worthy
of mention.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> This is described as a hollow ball having a
diameter of about 21 cm. The sphere itself is made of
copper, the remaining parts of gilded brass. The horizon
circle is composed of several overlapping brass plates. A
clockwork mechanism is supplied, by means of which the
sphere and certain circles may be made to revolve. The
surface of the copper sphere is artistically engraved,
having numerous circles representing the ecliptic system
with its parallels and meridians, and the equatorial system
including its five zones. The Ptolemaic constellations are
represented, the figure of each being engraved in outline
with the name in Latin. The several stars are not named but
near each is an engraved number to indicate its magnitude,
these numbers ranging from 1 to 6. Nebulae are distinguished
by small circles, and the Milky Way by numerous dots. The
meridian circle, in which the sphere revolves, has the usual
graduation from 0 to 90, but has in addition a climatic
graduation designed &#8220;Climata ex Ptolomeo,&#8221; and a division
into zones called &#8220;Torrida Zona,&#8221; &#8220;Zona habitabilis
temperata,&#8221; and &#8220;Frigida zona.&#8221; On the convex surface of the
horizon circle we find engraved the names of the four
cardinal points, and on the upper surface of this circle are
engraved the Julian and the Gregorian calendars, the names
of the saints, the dates on which the sun enters the various
signs of the zodiac, and the ancient names of the principal
winds. The globe mountings, all of brass, are artistic and
well preserved. Like the Dresden example it rests upon a
four-branched support, the extremities of each branch
representing the claws of the griffin. Including the base,
the instrument is 43 cm. in height. It seems not to be known
when or how this globe, constructed in Augsburg, found its
way to the Naples <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>Museum, where it is treasured as one
of the choicest of ancient astronomical instruments.</p>

<p>Tycho Brahe, the great Danish astronomer (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f75">75</a>), was
a native of Knudtstrup near Helsingborg, born in the year
1546.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> The care of his early education was assumed by an
uncle, George Brahe, who in the year 1559 sent him to the
Academy of Copenhagen with the intention of fitting him for
the legal profession. Three years later we find him
registered at the University of Leipzig, then famous for its
department of jurisprudence. Like many another of the
world&#8217;s great men for whom, in the days of his youth,
interested relatives or friends have chosen a life career
only to find in later life the choice not well made, Tycho&#8217;s
bent was not for the legal profession but for science, that
is, for mathematics and astronomy. While yet a student in
Copenhagen an eclipse of the sun which occurred August 21,
1560, interested him greatly, and here we seem to find the
beginning of that great future which was to be his.
Forbidden by his schoolmaster to give his time to a study of
the stars, in the quiet of the night he would secretly
betake himself into the open, there to watch with unaided
eye the movements of the heavenly bodies, or to follow these
movements as best he could with the assistance of a simple
astronomical circle and a small celestial globe which he had
been able to purchase. It probably was in his Leipzig days
that he became intimate with Bartholomaus Scultetus
(Schultz), lecturer on mathematical subjects, and by him was
encouraged to pursue further his astronomical studies. Among
the first practical results of his activities in this field
we have his correction table for readings with the Jacob
staff. The death of his uncle in the year 1565 occasioned
his return to his native country, but Germany offering him
special opportunities for continued study in his favorite
field, we soon find him in Wittenberg, later in Rostock,
where in a quarrel with a peasant he lost part of his nose
and thereafter to the end of his days wore a silver
substitute. In 1567 we find him <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>in Lauingen engaged in
the study of astronomy with the distinguished Cyprian
Leowitz, in 1568 in Basel with Peter Ramus, and for two
years thereafter in Augsburg with the brothers Johan and
Paul Hainzel, with whom he constructed a large quadrant
having a radius of seventeen and one half feet. While in
Augsburg it appears that he began the construction of a
celestial globe four feet in diameter, but there is some
uncertainty as to his completion of this work. A short but
unhappy sojourn in his native town followed his years of
congenial study in Germany, and we soon learn of his visit
to the observatory of Landgraf Wilhelm of Cassel, an event
of great significance for him. His travels carried him to
other cities of Germany, including the city of Regensburg,
where he witnessed the coronation of the Emperor Rudolf II.
Landgraf Wilhelm, a Maecenas of wide repute in his day, had
been greatly impressed with the abilities of Tycho, and he
urged upon the Danish King Frederick that he should make
suitable provision for the further astronomical studies of
his distinguished subject, which suggestion the King
generously met. In the year 1575 the documents were signed
and sealed granting to Tycho full possession for life of the
little Island of Hveen, lying between Seeland and Schonen;
in addition he was furnished with all the means necessary
for the erection of an observatory and the adequate
equipment of the same (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f76">76</a>). The Uranienburg, as
his observatory was called,<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> became a great center for
astronomical studies, and students came to him from various
European lands, among these being Arnold van Langren, Willem
Jansz. Blaeu, and Longomontanus (Christian Severin of
Longberg). The death of his patron, King Frederick II, in
the year 1588 brought misfortune to Tycho, in so far as his
life and studies on the Island of Hveen were concerned,
since the succeeding ruler, Christian IV, was but little
interested in the further promotion of astronomical science.
Enduring court intrigue for nine years, he determined, in
the year 1597, to leave the scenes of his remarkable
successes, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>after a brief sojourn with Count Henry of
Ranzau near Hamburg, he accepted an invitation from the
Emperor Rudolf II to become imperial astronomer and
counselor at Prague. Thither he went with his family in the
year 1599, at the same time taking with him those
astronomical instruments which had served him in his studies
in the northern island home. While preparations were under
way for the erection of a new observatory for him he died in
the year 1601. From Tycho&#8217;s heirs the Emperor Rudolf
purchased his instruments and manuscripts, the latter
passing into the hands of Kepler, his successor at the
Imperial Court, but as to the fate of his instruments little
seems to be known. K&auml;stner tells us that in 1619,
during an uprising in the city of Prague, some of these were
destroyed while others were carried away, and at present
only an iron quadrant, once in his observatory, remains in
that city.</p>

<p>His large brass celestial globe, six feet in diameter, was
carried back to Copenhagen in the year 1623 by King
Christian&#8217;s son, Ulrich, and there it was carefully kept
until the year 1728, when with the castle in which it had
been placed it was destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>Recalling the far-reaching influence of Tycho Brahe on
astronomical studies and on celestial globe making, it
cannot be without interest to quote here his own reference
to his great globe, wherein he describes its construction.</p>

<p>&#8220;This globe,&#8221; he says,<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> &#8220;which is a very large one, we
have made with great care, but with none the less than we
have employed in all of our others. The interior is of wood
with many intersecting circles and special supports,
strengthened here and there from the center, and being then
fashioned into a spherical shape. As for its parts of wood,
these were made at Augsburg in the year 1570 before I
returned to my native land, as I found there a capable
workman, having sought for a long time elsewhere in vain for
such an one. There, on account of its size, which made it
difficult to move, it had remained for five years, when I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>returned to Augsburg; this was in the year 1575 as I
came out of Italy on my way to Ratisbon to be present at the
coronation of the August Emperor Rudolf II, when I found the
globe had been finished some time previously. But its shape
(sphericity) did not altogether satisfy me, moreover certain
cracks could be seen. In the following year, and not without
much difficulty I had it carried to Denmark. There the
cracks were filled in and the sphericity made more nearly
perfect by laying over the surface about one hundred skins.
There followed a testing for a period of two years to
ascertain whether the cracks would reappear after two
summers and two winters. When, after this test, I saw that
it retained its sphericity, I covered it over with thin
brass plates of uniform thickness without mishap, and this I
did with such care and skill that you would be led to say
the globe was made of solid brass, the joinings of the
plates being scarcely visible. I next fashioned it into a
perfect sphere and marked thereon the zodiac, and the
equator with its poles, also the degrees each of sixty
minutes by engraved lines as we do in such work. I then left
it for the space of one year, as there was some doubt after
putting on the brass plates as to whether the globe would
retain its sphericity in winter and in summer. When it had
been sufficiently tested not only did I indicate the circles
of which I have spoken but also all the stars of the eighth
sphere I represented in their proper places, as many stars
as were to be seen in the heavens, and I increased their
number more and more in succeeding years up to 1600. Thus I
with purpose added all the stars visible to the naked eye,
in their proper places adapted to the year 1600 which was
near at hand. And so there passed nearly twenty-five years
from the first work on this globe until it was finished, by
the addition of its proper divisions and its stars. This
delay, although it might seem tedious, was not without its
value; for all things were thus done more carefully and
better. &#8216;Work quickly only if you work well.&#8217; Then the outer
circles were fitted to it, that is, a meridian and <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>after that a horizon
circle. This meridian is made of brass, and each degree is
divided into minutes, and the horizon has the width of a
palm of the hand, being covered with brass having the
degrees and minutes marked. The vertical quadrant passing
from the zenith to the horizon is of brass.</p>

<p>&#8220;The globe rests on a firm base having two iron supports
crossing each other, two of which you see on one side and
two on the other. These are for the purpose of giving
strength lest the horizon of the instrument should not be
firm because of its bulk and weight.</p>

<p>&#8220;The entire support is five feet high, and on the lower part
of the structure various mathematical devices are to be seen
skilfully painted for the sake of ornamentation, and with
the other features adding beauty to the whole. The globe
itself is approximately six feet in diameter, and from this
dimension the size of the meridian, of the horizon and of
the rest of the instrument can be obtained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a globe, so solidly made, so finely wrought, and in
every part so finely constructed and properly constituted
never before in any part of the world, so I believe and say
without the thought of arousing envy, has been completed. It
is an immense and a magnificent work; so much so that many
have come from various countries to Denmark that they might
have a view of it together with my other instruments, while
the Kingdom of Urania and its far-famed citadel were
standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Around the horizon circle one could read in letters of gold
&#8216;In the year of Christ CI&#390; I&#390; XXCIV (1584),
Frederick II reigning in Denmark, this globe like unto a
celestial machine, in which are fixed the stars of the
eighth sphere as set down on his globe each exactly in its
place, also the wandering stars as they appear among these,
Tycho Brahe, to all on earth who desire to understand this
matter, shows the heavens by this mechanical device which he
perfected for his sons, for himself and for posterity.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The date 1584 is inscribed hereon because that is the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>middle of the period of
time in which it was in the process of construction, and
further it is the year before the death of King Frederick of
most worthy memory, who liberally supported both myself and
my work, and his princely love followed me as long as he
lived. I will add only this one thing&mdash;this globe has a
canopy indicated by Y Z (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f77">77</a>) circular, and concave
within to enclose the upper half of the globe, which canopy,
fastened to the roof by a chain, may be let down as a
protection from dust and from other injury. The use of the
globe is the same as is that of others, and this use I have
decided to describe in a special work during my leisure
time, since it cannot be done in few words. This globe has,
on account of its great size, an advantage over all others,
namely that all details on it can be given with the utmost
exactness and minuteness. And those points concerning the
doctrine of the <i>primum mobilum</i> and the study of the
heavenly bodies in their relations to the position of the
ecliptic and the equator and of certain other circles on the
globe, are easily determined with a minimum of trouble and
without any laborious effort, by the machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aside from its geographical interest it is particularly
significant in that it is the only globe of metal known to
have been made in Rouen in that period. It is neither signed
nor dated, but its inscriptions seem to assure us that it
was not made prior to 1578, yet in all probability before
1600. It seems not to be known how the globe found its way
into the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>locality designated. The Abb&eacute;
L&#8217;&Eacute;cuy died in Paris in the year 1634 at the age of
eighty-four, Vicar General of the Prebendary of N&ocirc;tre
Dame. It is probable that at the death of the Abb&eacute;
the globe was taken to the province of Cher by some dealer
or purchaser, as he was born in the town Yvoi-Carignan in
French Luxembourg. Of the earliest history of this
remarkably interesting object we know only that it was made
in Rouen, at a date we cannot definitely fix.</p>

<p>It has a diameter of 25.6 cm. In an oval cartouch one finds
the inscription &#8220;Nova et integra universi orbis descriptio.
Rothomagi.&#8221; &#8220;A new and complete description of the world.
Rouen.&#8221; Below the last line there appears to be space left
for the insertion of the author&#8217;s name, a thought suggested
by the arrangement for the inscription, and underneath the
cartouch is engraved a representation of Neptune driving his
sea horses and chariot and armed with a trident. There are
numerous vessels represented on the globe, sailing the seas,
in the style of the sixteenth century. The prime meridian
passes through the Canary Islands. The author seems to have
drawn largely from Spanish sources, but to some extent from
the Portuguese.</p>

<p>The outlines of the several countries of the Old World are
not particularly well drawn, and it does not appear that the
author thought of making an especial point of accuracy.
Africa has the outlines of the maps of the sixteenth
century, but with an indifference to details. The Senegal
and the Niger are made to unite to form the Nile. Asia is
not particularly well drawn. Below the island of Cipango the
author has engraved the following legend, &#8220;Hoc loco secuti
sumus recentiores hanc partem verius a continente
separantes.&#8221; &#8220;In this place we have followed the most recent
(observers) who rightly separate this part from the
continent.&#8221;</p>

<p>The western coast of America gives evidence of a want of
detailed knowledge. Here we read &#8220;Haec littora nondum
cognita,&#8221; &#8220;this coast is not yet known,&#8221; and below this,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>&#8220;Novus orbis,&#8221; and &#8220;Hispania major a Nu&ntilde;o Gusmano
devicta anno 1539,&#8221; &#8220;Greater Spain conquered by Nu&ntilde;o
Gusman in the year 1539.&#8221; California is represented as a
peninsula and not an island as on so many of the maps of the
closing years of the sixteenth century. The nomenclature
along the coast of Mexico is exceedingly rich. Pizarro&#8217;s
conquest is referred to, but Chili is unknown, &#8220;Ulterius
incognitum.&#8221; The estuary of La Plata is represented as very
large. The coast names north of Florida seem to have been
obtained from the Verrazano sources of 1524. In the region
of Newfoundland, which is represented as a region of
numerous small islands, we find &#8220;Baccalearum regio,&#8221;
&#8220;Gamas,&#8221; &#8220;insule Corteralis,&#8221; &#8220;terro de laborador.&#8221; The
strait separating Greenland from the mainland is referred to
as &#8220;Fretum arcticum per quod Lusitani in orientem et ad
Indos et Molucas navigare conati sunt,&#8221; &#8220;Arctic strait
through which the Portuguese attempted to sail to the east
and to the Indies and the Moluccas,&#8221; an allusion to the
unhappy results of the Cortereal expedition. Along the coast
of the strait which forms the northern boundary of North
America we read &#8220;Terra per Britannos inventa,&#8221; &#8220;Land
discovered by the British.&#8221; A very curious legend along the
east coast of Greenland reads &#8220;Quii populi ad quos
Joa&ntilde;es Scovus Danus pervenit anno 1476,&#8221; &#8220;These are
the people to whom the Dane John Scovus came in the year
1476.&#8221; Humboldt was one of the first to call attention to
this expedition, and Gomara was actually the first to
mention it, that is, to give a reference to the Dane
Skolnus.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></p>

<p>There are no more interesting survivals among the globes of
the late sixteenth century than are those constructed by
Emery Molyneux, now belonging to the Middle Temple Library
of London (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f79">79</a>), which Sir Clements Markham refers
to as &#8220;their burial place,&#8221; considering this to be &#8220;a
strange depository for geographical documents of such
interest and importance.&#8221; In the address &#8220;To the Reader&#8221; or
preface to his &#8216;Voyages,&#8217; Hakluyt gives the first reference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>in print to these globes. &#8220;Nowe,&#8221; he says, &#8220;because
peraduenture it would bee expected as necessarie, that the
descriptions of so many parts of the world would farre more
easily be conceiued of the Readers, by adding Geographicall,
and Hydrographicall tables thereunto, thou art by the way to
be admonished that I have contented my selfe with inserting
into the worke one of the best generall mappes of the world
onely, untill the coming out of a very large and most exact
terrestriall Globe, collected and reformed according to the
newest, secretest, and latest discoueries, both Spanish,
Portugall, and English, composed by M. Emmerie Mollineux of
Lambeth, a rare gentleman in his profession, being therein
for diuers yeeres, gratly supported by the purse and
liberalitie of the worshipfull marchant M. William
Sanderson.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> It was not until near the close of the year
1592 that the globes were completed, and soon thereafter we
have their first printed description, which description was
given by Dr. Hood of Trinity College, Cambridge, a lecturer
on mathematics and navigation in the city of London.<a

published the first edition of his most valuable and
interesting treatise on globes, bearing the title,
&#8216;Tractatus de Globis et eorum usu, accomodatus iis qui
Londini editi sunt anno 1593,&#8217; taking the Molyneux globes as

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;79. Terrestrial Globe of Emery Molyneux, 1592.</p> </div>

<p>Very little is known of the life of Molyneux. He appears to
have been a member of the Cavendish expedition of the years
1586-1588, as is suggested by one of the legends on his
terrestrial globe. He was known to Sir Walter Raleigh, to
Richard Hakluyt, to Edward Wright, and to John Davis. To the
suggestions of the last-named we perhaps owe the existence
of these globes.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> As noted by Hakluyt in his preface, the
globes were constructed at the expense of William Sanderson,
a merchant prince of London, a liberal and patriotic

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>Sir Clements Markham, in his edition of Robert Hues&#8217;
&#8216;Tractatus de Globis,&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> edited for the Hakluyt Society and
published in the year 1889, gives in his introduction the
following brief but adequate description of these globes:
&#8220;The Molyneux globes are 2 feet 2 inches in diameter, and
are fixed on stands. They have graduated brass meridians,
and on that of the terrestrial globe a dial circle or
&#8216;Horarius&#8217; is fixed. The broad wooden equator, forming the
upper part of the stand, is painted with the zodiac signs,
the months, the Roman calendar, the points of the compass,
and the same in Latin, in concentric circles. Rhumb lines
are drawn from numerous centers over the surface of the
terrestrial globe. The equator, the ecliptic, the polar
circles are painted boldly; while the parallels of latitude
and meridians, at every ten degrees, are very faint lines.
The globe received additions, including the discoveries of
Barents in Novaya Zemlya, and the date has been altered with
a pen from 1592 to 1603. The constellations and fixed stars
on the celestial globe are the same as those on the globe of
Mercator, except that the Southern Cross has been added. On
both the celestial and the terrestrial globes of Molyneux
there is a square label with this inscription &#8216;This globe,
belonging to the Middle Temple, was repaired in the year
1818 by J. and W. Newton, Globe Makers, Chancery Lane.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over North America are the arms of France and England
quarterly; supporters, a lion and dragon; motto of the
garter; crown, crest, and baldrequin; standing on a label,
with a long dedication to Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;The achievement of Mr. William Sanderson is painted on the
imaginary southern continent to the south of Africa. The
crest is a globe with the sun&#8217;s rays behind. It stands on a
squire&#8217;s helmet with baldrequin. The shield is quarterly;
1st, paly of six azure and argent, over all a bend sable for
Sanderson; 2nd, gules, lions, and castles in the quarters
for Skirne alias Castilion; 3rd, or, a chevron between 3
eagles displayed sable, in chief a label of three points
sable for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>Wall; 4th, quarterly, or and azure, over all a
bend gules for Langston. Beneath there is an address from
William Sanderson to the gentle reader, English and Latin,
in parallel columns.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the north polar regions there are several new additions,
delineating the discoveries of English and Dutch explorers
for the first time. John Davis wrote, in his &#8216;World&#8217;s
Hydrographical Discovery&#8217;: &#8216;How far I proceeded doth appear
on the globe made by Master Emerie Molyneus.&#8217; Davis Strait
is shown with all the names on its shores which were given
by its discoverer, and the following legend &#8216;Joannes Davis
Anglus anno 1583-86-87 littora Americae circumspectantia a
quinquagesimo quinto grado ad 73 sub polarem scrutando
perlegit.&#8217; (&#8216;John Davis, an Englishman in the years
1583-86-87, gave these names when he mapped the shores of
America lying between the parallels of 55 degrees and 73
degrees north latitude.&#8217;) On another legend we have
&#8216;Additions in the north parts to 1603&#8217;; and below it are the
discoveries of Barents, with his Novaya Zemlya winter
quarters&mdash;&#8216;Het behouden huis.&#8217; Between Novaya Zemlya
and Greenland there is an island called &#8216;Sir Hugo Willoghbi
his land.&#8217; This insertion arose from a great error in
longitude, Willoughby having sighted the coast of Novaya
Zemlya; and the island, of course had no existence, though
it long remained on the maps. To the north of Siberia there
are two legends, &#8216;Rd. Cancelarius et Stephanus Burrow Angli
Lappiae et Coreliae oras marinas et Simm. S. Nicolai vulgo
dictum anno 1553 menso Augusto exploraverunt&#8217; (&#8216;Richard
Chancelor and Stephen Burrow Englishmen explored the shore
of Lapland and Corelia, and of Simm. S. Nicolai commonly so
called, in the month of August 1553&#8217;), and &#8216;Joannes
Mandevillanus eques Anglius ex Anglia anno 1332 Cathaiae et
Tartariae regiones penetravenit.&#8217; (&#8216;John Mandeville an
English knight from England in the year 1322 entered the
regions of Cathay and Tartary.&#8217;)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>&#8220;Many imaginary islands, in the Atlantic, are retained
on the globe: including &#8216;Frisland,&#8217; &#8216;Buss Ins,&#8217; &#8216;Brasil,&#8217;
&#8216;Maidas,&#8217; &#8216;Heptapolis,&#8217; &#8216;St. Brandan.&#8217; On the eastern side
of North America are the countries of Florida, Virginia, and
Norumbega; and also a large town of Norumbega up a gulf full
of islands.</p>

<p>&#8220;The learned Dr. Dee had composed a treatise on the title of
Queen Elizabeth to Norumbega; and in modern times Professor
Horsford has written a memoir to identify Norumbega with a
site up the Charles River, near Boston. On the Atlantic,
near the American coast, is the following legend &#8216;Virginia
primum lustrata, habitata, et cultu ab Anglis impensis D.
Gualteri de Ralegh Equitis Aurati ammenti Elizabethae
Angliae Reginae.&#8217; (&#8216;Virginia first surveyed, inhabited and
cultivated by the English at the expense of Sir Walter
Raleigh, Knight, subsidized by the gold of Elizabeth Queen
of England.&#8217;)</p>

<p>&#8220;A legend in the Pacific Ocean furnishes direct evidence
that information, for compiling the globe was supplied by
Sir Walter Raleigh. It is in Spanish: &#8216;Islas estas descubrio
Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa por la Corona de Castella y Leon
desde el ano 1568 llamolas Islas de Jesus aunque vulfarmente
las llaman Islas de Salomon.&#8217; (&#8216;Pedro Sarmiento of Gamboa
discovered these islands in the year 1568 for the crown of
Castile and Leon calling them the Islands of Jesus though
they are commonly called the Salomon Islands.&#8217;)</p>

<p>&#8220;Pedro Sarmiento was the officer who was sent to fortify the
Strait of Magellan after Drake had passed through. He was
taken prisoner by an English ship on his way to Spain, and
was the guest of Raleigh in London for several weeks, so
that it must have been on information communicated by
Raleigh that the statement respecting Sarmiento on this
legend was based.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides &#8216;Insulae Salmonis&#8217; there are two islands in the
Pacific, &#8216;Y Sequenda de los Tubarones,&#8217; and &#8216;San Pedro,&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>as well as the north coast of New Guinea, with the names
given on Mercator&#8217;s map.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cavendish also appears to have given assistance, or
possibly Molyneux himself accompanied that circumnavigator
in his voyage of 1587. The words of a legend off the
Patagonian coast seem to countenance this idea, reading,
&#8216;Thomas Caundish 18 Dec. 1587 haec terra sub nostris oculis
primum obtulit sub latitud 47 cujus seu admodum salubris
Incolae maturi ex parte proceri sunt gigantes et vasti
magnitudinis.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The great southern continent is made to include Tierra del
Fuego and the south coast of Magellan&#8217;s Strait, and extends
over the greater part of the south frigid zone.</p>

<p>&#8220;S. Matheo, an island in the Atlantic, south of the line,
was visited by the Spanish ships under Loaysa and Sebastian
del Cano, but has never been seen since. It appears on the
globe. In the south Atlantic there are painted a
sea-serpent, a whale, Orpheus riding on a dolphin, and ships
under full sail&mdash;fore and main courses and topsails, a
sprit sail, and the mizzen with a long lateen yard.</p>

<p>&#8220;The track of the voyage of Sir Francis Drake and Master
Thomas Cavendish round the world are shown, the one by a red
and the other by a blue line. That these tracks were put on
when the globe was first made is proved by the reference to
them in Blundeville&#8217;s &#8216;Exercises.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The name of the author of the globe is thus given: &#8216;Emerum
Mullineus Angl. sumptibus Guilelm Sanderson Londinensis
descripsit.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Markham likewise tells us that the celestial globe, in its
general features, closely resembles the terrestrial. It
carries the same arms of Sanderson, and the same label of
Newton, but a briefer dedication to the Queen. It appears
that the map was engraved and printed by Hondius of
Amsterdam, since it carries the brief legend &#8220;Judocus
Hondius Fon. Sc.&#8221; In addition to the Molyneux globes in the
Middle Temple, a pair may be found in the Royal Museum of
Cassel. A <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>detailed description of this pair it has not
been possible to obtain.</p>

<p>Jost B&uuml;rgi, a native of Lichtensteig in the Toggenburg,
Switzerland, was born in the year 1552 and died in Cassel in
the year 1632.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> Early in life he became a clock maker&#8217;s
apprentice, and for some time was engaged with Dasypodius in
the construction of the famous Strassburg Cathedral clock.
In the year 1579 he was called to the court of Landgrave
William IV in Cassel, under whose patronage he won great
distinction as a maker of astronomical and mathematical
instruments. In the year 1603 he was called into the service
of the Emperor at Prague, but in the year 1631 he returned
to Cassel, where he died in the following year. B&uuml;rgi,
skilful workman that he was, seems not to have found time to
tell in words of his various activities. &#8220;He found pleasure
in work,&#8221; says one of his biographers, and left it for
others to write of his attainments, which, it may here be
said, they seem not to have done in a very detailed manner.</p>

<p>Landgrave William&#8217;s interest in the promotion of scientific
studies led him to the founding of a museum to which he made
numerous contributions of apparatus, mathematical and
astronomical. This museum, in the course of years, became
one of the most famous of its kind in all Europe, and indeed
remains such to this day. In its collections the work of
B&uuml;rgi is well represented, which in the quality of the
workmanship exhibited, as in the interest it awakens by
reason of its place as a nucleus around which so much of
value has been gathered, is unsurpassed.</p>

<p>Among the first of his instruments may be mentioned an
astronomical clock, elaborately wrought, with movable discs
and circles for illustrating the movements of the heavenly
bodies, and surmounted with an engraved celestial globe,
which, driven by clockwork, is made to turn on its axis once
in twenty-four hours. It seems evident that B&uuml;rgi
constructed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>other clocks of like character, supplied, as
is this example, with a celestial globe.</p>

<p>In this same Museum of Cassel there is a second celestial
globe, the work of B&uuml;rgi, which was begun in the year
1585, and not entirely completed until the year 1693 by
Heinrich van Lannep.&nbsp;This copper sphere, 72 cm. in
diameter, is remarkably well preserved. It has a heavy brass
meridian circle to which is attached an engraved hour circle
46 cm. in diameter. A large brass semicircle intersects this
meridian circle at right angles through the north pole, and
is attached to the horizon circle at its extremities. The
instrument rests upon an artistic and substantial brass
support. On the surface of the sphere are engraved the
principal celestial circles, including the colures, the
equator, the tropics, the polar circles, the ecliptic, and
twelve parallels. The stars, of which the largest are
distinguished by a bit of inlaid silver, and the several
figures of the constellations which are very artistically
engraved, are clearly the work of a master.</p>

<p>A third globe of gilded brass, containing clockwork within
by means of which it is made to revolve and apparently the
work of B&uuml;rgi, may also be found in this Cassel
collection. A small silver sun, movable along the equator,
is mechanically attached in such manner as to serve
admirably for demonstrative purposes. The engraved surface
of the globe is equal in its artistic merits to that of the
copper globe referred to above.</p>

<p>There is yet a fourth metal globe in this collection,
apparently the work of B&uuml;rgi, which is not gilded. In
other respects it is said to resemble the one designated
above as the third globe. Kepler is said to have held in the
highest esteem the scientific work of B&uuml;rgi, and to
have placed him, within his field, as high as he did
Albrecht D&uuml;rer among artists. There appears to be good
reason for attributing the invention of the pendulum clock
to Jost B&uuml;rgi, and that before 1600 he had proved this
method of clock regulation practical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>Among the numerous and interesting treasures to be found
in the Landesmuseum of Z&uuml;rich is a terrestrial globe
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f80">80</a>) having neither name of maker nor date of
construction, but belonging, undoubtedly, to the late
sixteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> The sphere has a diameter of about 121
cm., is mounted on a substantial wooden base, and appears to
have been made for the monastery of St. Gall, from which
place it was taken to Z&uuml;rich in the year 1712. On the
semicircular arms which support the equatorial circle are
represented the armorial bearings of the abbey and monks of
St. Gall, and the date in gold, 1595, which may refer to the
date of construction or to the date when it was placed in
the monastery. On the equatorial circle one finds
represented the signs of the zodiac, the calendar, the names
of the saints and of the winds. On the heavy meridian circle
are indicated the climatic zones and the degrees of
latitude. The prime meridian is made to pass through the
Azores Islands. The sphere is of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;
and plaster, on which the engraved gores are mounted. The
seas have been colored green, the lands a dull yellow, the
mountain ranges brown. Numerous barbaric kings are
represented in picture, likewise numerous animals of land
and sea, and ships artistically drawn sail hither and
thither over the oceans. The austral continent is wanting.
Marcel especially notes the striking resemblance of the
globe map to the Mercator map of 1569, suggesting the
possibility of its Mercatorian origin, in support of which
suggestion he quotes a number of geographical names as well
as certain legends. The globe, it appears, has never been
critically studied, but is clearly an interesting
geographical monument of the period.</p>

<p>The making of globe-goblets in the latter half of the
sixteenth century and early seventeenth appears to have been
in response to a fashion especially pronounced in South
Germany, although their construction was not limited to that
region. Not a few of such globes are extant, which are fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>examples of the metal worker&#8217;s art, having, however, a
decorative rather than a scientific value.</p>

<p>Professor Fischer gives us an interesting description of
such a goblet of gilded silver (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f81">81</a>), dating from
the end of the sixteenth or the beginning of the seventeenth
century, and it is from his account that the following
reference is taken.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> This piece he pronounces the most
valuable treasure in the plate room of the princely castle
of Wolfegg, to which castle it was the author&#8217;s privilege to
pay a most interesting visit more than a decade ago. The
globe was long considered a christening gift from the
Emperor Francis to his godson Francis of the Waldburg zu
Wolfegg princely family and was supposed to date from the
end of the eighteenth century. Professor Fischer, however,
found this &#8220;globis terrestris&#8221; referred to in a testament
dated January 17, 1779, with instructions that it, with
certain other treasures, should not be recast or otherwise
altered from its ancient form. It was at that time
recognized as a masterpiece, but from the hands of an
unknown master, and not until recently was it definitely
determined to be the work of the Z&uuml;rich goldsmith,
Abraham Gessner (1552-1613). &#8220;Gessner appears to have
manufactured his globe-goblets,&#8221; says Fischer, &#8220;not in
response to orders previously given, but in the regular
pursuit of his trade. At a time when rich merchants and
scholars took such a lively interest in geography, and the
opening up of new countries, he could count upon a market
all the more readily because his goblets were made with the
utmost care in every detail and were perfect examples of the
various branches of the goldsmith&#8217;s art; casting, embossing,
chasing, engraving, and solid gilding.&#8221;<a

of Abraham Gessner, ca. 1600." title="" />

<p class="caption">Fig.&nbsp;81. Globe-Goblet of Abraham Gessner, ca. 1600.</p> </div>

<p>The goblet is 58 cm. in height. Its larger globe, a
terrestrial, is composed of two hemispheres joined on the
line of the equator, and has a diameter of 17 cm. The
support is a standing figure of Atlas, which also serves as
a stem of the lower half or the lower goblet, just as the
celestial sphere <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>with its support which tops the piece
serves as the stem of the upper half or upper goblet.</p>

<p>The oceans, lakes, and rivers have a silver surface, while
the continents, islands, sea monsters, sailing vessels,
principal parallels, and meridians are gilded. The
continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and the &#8220;terra
australis sive Magallanica&#8221; have their outlines drawn in the
main as they appear on Mercator&#8217;s map of 1569. While certain
recent discoveries as &#8220;Nowaja Semlja&#8221; (Nova Zembla) are
represented, it does not appear that Gessner was inclined to
insist on his map records being laid down with the strictest
accuracy as to geographical detail.</p>

<p>The celestial globe topping the goblet is given an artistic
setting. It is furnished with horizon, meridian, and hour
circles. The several constellations represented on the
surface of the sphere are, through gilding, given special
prominence, their execution, like other parts of the piece,
being of the finest workmanship.</p>

<p>The figure of Atlas supporting the globes exhibits skill in
its construction. It stands with one foot slightly advanced,
with the right hand extended upward as if to catch the ball
should it fall from the head of the figure. The hair and the
beard are gilded, as is also the drapery, one end of which
hangs loosely over the right shoulder, while the other
covers the front of the body and is held in the left hand at
the back, being made to serve in part as a support.</p>

<p>Fischer calls attention to two globe-goblets belonging to
the University of Basel and to one privately owned; to one
in the town hall of Rappoltsweiler; one in what was formerly
the Rothschild Collection of Frankfurt, and to one in the
Museum of Stockholm, once the property of Gustavus Adolphus,
which probably is the one elsewhere referred to; and he also
calls attention to an undated globe-goblet, purchased in
Paris in the year 1901 by the Swiss National Museum of
Z&uuml;rich for the sum of forty-two thousand francs. It had
previously been referred to by Marcel as the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>work of Gessner, in proof
of which he noted that it bears the mark of this goldsmith,
the same being the letter &#8220;Z.&#8221; The terrestrial globe, like
that of Wolfegg, has a diameter of 17 cm., the whole being
very artistically designed and engraved. It, too, is
surmounted by a celestial globe and rests on a figure of
Atlas, which figure in turn stands upon an ornamental base.
Each of the two globes can be opened on the line of the
equator, thus practically making four drinking cups. On the
terrestrial globe, Marcel notes, California is represented
as an island. Near &#8220;Nova Guinea&#8221; one finds the inscription
&#8220;Nova Guinea semper inventa qual ... insula an pars
continentas australis.&#8221; A large austral land is represented
with the inscription &#8220;Hanc continentem australem nonvulli
Magelanicam regionem ab ejus inventore nuncupant.&#8221; The
absence of the Strait of Lemaire and of New Zealand, with
the representation of the austral land with more or less
indefinite outline, Marcel thinks warrants a belief that it
was constructed near the close of the sixteenth century.
Attention is likewise called by Marcel in his article to
three other small globes which he found in the Museum des
Cordeliers of Basel, and also to one &#8220;tr&egrave;s beau et
tr&egrave;s riche&#8221; in the Muse&eacute; Ariana of Geneva.</p>

<p>A very artistic gold beaker globe (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f82">82</a>) may be
found in the collection presented by Mr. J. P. Morgan to the
Metropolitan Museum of New York City. The sphere of this,
which opens on the line of the ecliptic, has a diameter of 8
cm. and rests upon the figure of a satyr with uplifted hands
forming a part of the support, this figure in turn resting
upon an ornamental circular base. Topping the sphere is a
small figure of Neptune carrying a trident and standing in a
shell or conventionalized small boat. The engraved figures
of the many constellations decorate the surface of the
sphere.</p>

<p>In the private library of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan may be
found a fine example of an ivory terrestrial globe of this
period (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f83">83</a>). It is hollow, being composed of two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>hemispheres joined on the line of the equator, and has a
diameter of about 8 cm. Near the south pole is the author
and date legend (Figs. <a href="#f84">84</a>, <a href="#f84a">84a</a>) &#8220;Antonius Spano tropiensis
fecit 1593.&#8221; &#8220;Made by Antonio Spano of Tropea, 1593.&#8221; In the
unnamed southern continent, and over a representation of the
Spanish arms, is the dedication to the Infante Philip,
afterward Philip III, reading &#8220;Principi Philip.&nbsp;Philip
II Hisp.&nbsp;Indiar. Neap.&nbsp;e Siciliae Cathol. Regis
Filio,&#8221; and within the Antarctic circle a salutation reading
&#8220;Princeps felicissime totus Orbis ad se gubernandum te vocat
et expectat.&#8221; &#8220;O most fortunate ruler, the whole world calls
and awaits you to govern it.&#8221; Antonio, a native of Tropea,
near Naples, was granted in the year 1595 a pension of one
hundred ducats, by his master and patron, Philip II. This he
seems to have enjoyed until his death, which occurred in
Madrid in the year 1615. We learn that this was continued to
his son, Francisco Spano, by King Philip III. The mounting
of the globe, which is simple, seems to be of a later date
than that given as the year of construction in the date
legend, but it is well suited to the artistic piece. The
world map is well executed, and may be said to be in a
perfect state of preservation. Its geographical details, in
so far as given, are quite as good as the best to be found
at this time, though it is very evident that the piece was
primarily intended to possess decorative rather than
scientific value. The Mediterranean region gives us in its
general features a representation of the Ptolemaic ideas,
particularly to be observed in the representation of Italy
and the Caspian Sea. In Chinese Asia appears a legend
reading, &#8220;Hic artem impremendi ante mille a&ntilde;os
habuerunt.&#8221; &#8220;Here they had the art of printing a thousand
years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>In &#8220;Ratai&#8221; (Katai) a flag is represented reminding of Marco
Polo, and near this the legend &#8220;His magnus Cham Tartarorum

<p>In this Asiatic region we find such names as &#8220;Tabin,&#8221;
&#8220;Ania,&#8221; &#8220;Quinsai,&#8221; &#8220;Catigara,&#8221; &#8220;Zaiton,&#8221; &#8220;India Orientalis.&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>&#8220;Stretto Anian&#8221; appears as a long channel. In Africa we
read, &#8220;His Imperator magnus Presbyter Africae Rex potentis
mus.&#8221; In the New World we find &#8220;America sive India nova,&#8221;
which is not connected with Asia. The coast in the northern
regions is better drawn than in the southern. The St.
Lawrence River is represented, but the Great Lakes are
omitted. &#8220;Estland,&#8221; &#8220;Frisland,&#8221; and &#8220;St. Brandan&#8221; are laid
down. The austral land, as represented, is very large, being
designated &#8220;Terra Australis: Vastissimas his esse regiones
ex M. Pauli Ven. et Lud. Vartomani scriptis
perigrinationibus constat.&#8221; &#8220;Austral land: here is known to
be a very extensive region referred to in the travel records
of Marco Polo and of Ludovico Vartema.&#8221; Mr. Beazley says of
the globe that it once belonged to the Kempenaer family of
Leenwarden, and was later acquired by Mr. H. J. Pfungst
through the firm of Miller &amp; Company of Amsterdam.<a
name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> It later passed into
the library of Mr. Morgan.</p>

<p>As noted at the beginning of this chapter, leadership in
globe and map making, in the closing years of the century,
was passing into the Netherlands, which in the second
quarter of the century had contributed in this field of
scientific endeavor the great Mercator. His influence, as
was also noted, found its way into Italy and into favor with
certain globe makers, although the individualistic spirit of
the Italians seemed to show a marked preference for
manuscript and engraved metal globes. In the front rank of
those who were to lead the Low Countries into their place of
pre&euml;minence stood the Van Langren family, the father,
Jacobus Florentius, as he was accustomed to call himself,
and the sons, Arnoldus Florentius, Henricus Florentius, and
Michael Florentius.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> The father was a native of Denmark,
but sometime prior to 1580 he transferred his residence to
Arnhem in Gelderland, and later to Amsterdam. Legends on his
oldest extant globe give us to understand that at the time
of its construction he labored jointly with his son Arnold
in this work, these legends reading &#8220;Jacobus Florentius
Ultrajectensis <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>autor,&#8221; and &#8220;Arnoldus Florentius filius
sculptor Amstelodami 1585,&#8221; that is, the father was the
author and the son was the engraver.</p>

<p>In the early seventeenth century the family left Amsterdam,
going to Antwerp in the Spanish Netherlands. Here in the
year 1609, according to an Antwerp record, Arnold
constructed a &#8220;Sphaera Mundi,&#8221; which he dedicated to the
chief magistrate of that city, receiving therefor 120 Artois
livres. It probably was not long after this date that he was
appointed Globe Maker of the Archdukes, a title he retained
until the death of the Archduke Albert in the year 1621, and
a somewhat later record tells us that he was honored shortly
after that event by an appointment to the office of Royal
Cosmographer and Pensioner of His Majesty the Catholic King.
Michael became a resident of Brussels, where he carried on
his work as an engraver, particularly of maps, but it was as
an astronomer that he won special distinction, having given
much attention to the investigations of methods for the
determination of longitude and he is further credited with
having given the so-called seas of the moon the names by
which they are still known.</p>

<p>As globe maker perhaps the greater honor is due Jacobus
Florentius, since it appears that Arnold, though perhaps the
more active, reproduced in the main only the works of his
father, adding improvement here and there and endeavoring,
perhaps in part for business reasons, to keep his globe maps
up to date. Reference has been made above to the oldest
extant Van Langren globe, which bears the date 1585. Van der
Aa refers to a request of Arnold Floris van Langelaer and of
his father, Jacob Floris van Langelaer, presented to the
States of Gelderland and accompanying a copy of his globe,
which seems to have been dated 1580. Of this globe it is
stated that it was &#8220;een seer correcte ende schoone Globum
terrestrem, van de grootste forme,&#8221; and that it was
inscribed as is that of the year 1585. A doubt, however,
arises as to the accuracy of the date 1580, since Van der Aa
states <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>in the same article that Arnoldus was born in the
year 1571. This particular globe was formerly kept in the
&#8220;Geldersch Gerichtshof,&#8221; as Van Hasselt tells us, but since
the destruction of that court nothing has been known of the
inventory of the objects which had been placed therein. In
support, however, of an early date, perhaps 1580, for the
first Van Langren globe, we find in the dedication of a work
by Nicolas Petri, published in the year 1588, and issued as
a manual for the use of globes, that it was especially made
for the use of a Van Langren globe. In this work the author
is represented in picture in the act of examining a globe, a
picture practically the same as that appearing in a work by
Petri issued in the year 1583. It seems, therefore, not to
be an erroneous inference that the author gives us here a
representation of the Van Langren globe of 1580, which is
wanting much in the accuracy with which its details are
given.</p>

<p>The globe of 1585, referred to above as the oldest extant of
Van Langren, may be found in the collection of the Museo
dell&#8217; Osservatorio del Collegio Romano (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f84">84</a>). The
dedication under an elaborately colored coat of arms of
Denmark reads, &#8220;Serenissimo atque potentissimo Principi
Domino D. Christiano nn. Daniae Norvegiae Vandalorum et
Gothorum Regi Duci Slesvivi Holsatiae Stormariae et
Dithmortiae Comiti Oldenburgi et Del menorsti Jacobus
Florentius dedicabat.&#8221; &#8220;To the Most Serene and mighty Prince
Lord D. Christian King of Denmark, Norway, the Wends and the
Goths, Duke of Schleswick Holstein, Stormarn, Ditmarsh,
Count of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst (this globe) is dedicated
by Jacobus Florent.&#8221; The usual letter to the reader or to
the one who might have occasion to make use of the globe
gives the information: &#8220;In descriptione hujus globi ubiq:
sequuti sumus castigatissimas Tabulas geographicas quibus
Hispani et Lusitani in suis americis et indicis
navigationibus utantur; aliorumque probatissimas

usum navigantium ad amussim accomodavimus quaemadmodum
Geographiae candidati propius inspiciendo reperient. Vale
fruere.&#8221; &#8220;In the construction of this globe I have
everywhere made use of the most accurate geographical
tables, such as were used by the Spaniards and the
Portuguese in their voyages to America and the East Indies;
as also for the northern regions the very best drawings of
others. My own contribution has been to insert in the proper
places the nautical squares, as they are called, and the
directions of the winds, all of which I have carefully
adapted to the need of the navigator, as experts in
geography will, on examination, recognize. Farewell and may
you be happy.&#8221; In a cartouch on the left we read &#8220;Jacobus
Florentius Ultrajectensis autor,&#8221; and on the right &#8220;Arnoldus
Florentius filius sculptor Amstelodami 1585.&#8221; The sphere,
which is hollow, is constructed of wooden strips covered
with a preparation of plaster. It has a diameter of about 32
cm. and is therefore slightly smaller than is the Mercator
globe of 1541. It is furnished with a graduated brass
meridian circle and with a horizon circle of the same
material, which is supported by four arms or quadrants
upheld by a simple base. The engraved gores pasted on the
ball are twelve in number and extend to within twenty
degrees of the poles, the remaining space being covered with
an engraved circular disc, in accord with a method first
employed by Mercator. The surface of the globe is not well
preserved, yet notwithstanding the injuries which time has
brought to it, it remains a masterpiece of engraving and a
valuable geographical record of that early day. Its numerous
inscriptions are of much interest. We read, for example, in
latitude 35 degrees south and longitude 185 degrees,
&#8220;Vastissimas hic esse regiones ex M. Pauli Veneti et
Ludovico Vartomanni scriptis peregrinationibus liquido
constat.&#8221; &#8220;The voyage of Marco Polo and of Ludovico Varthema
make it certain that an enormous territory exists here.&#8221; In
latitude 16 degrees south and longitude 175 degrees is <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>the legend, &#8220;Moluccae
vocantur 5 insulae ordine postiae juxta Gilolo quarum
suprema Tarenare deinceps Tidore Motir Machiam et infima
Bachiam.&#8221; &#8220;The Moluccas is the name given to the five
islands in a row close to Gilolo, the uppermost of which is
Tarenare, then Tidore, Motir, Machiam, and the lowest
Bachiam.&#8221; In latitude 10 degrees south and longitude 348
degrees we read, &#8220;Mara&ntilde;on fluvius investus fuit a
Vincentio Ya&ntilde;es Pinzon an: 1499 et an: 1542 totus a
fontibus fere ad ostia usq: divulgatus a Francesco Oregliana
leucis 1560 mensibus 8 dulces in mari servat aquas usque 40
leucis.&#8221; &#8220;The Amazon River was discovered by Vicente
Ya&ntilde;ez Pinzon in 1499, while in 1542 Francisco
Orellana explored it a distance of 1560 leagues or almost
its entire length from source to mouth in eight months. In
the sea its waters are still fresh forty leagues from land.&#8221;
The following is placed in latitude 28 degrees north and
longitude 320 degrees, &#8220;B.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;1492. 12 octobris
Christophorus Columbus novam Indiam nomine regis Castellae
delexit, prima terra quam conquisit fuit Haiti nunc
Hispaniola.&#8221; &#8220;October 12, 1492, Christopher Columbus took
possession of New India in the name of the King of Castile.
The first land he conquered was called Haiti now called
Hispaniola.&#8221; In latitude 65 degrees north and longitude 230
degrees is the legend, &#8220;Regio deserta in qua equi oves et
boves silvestres sunt plurimi quales esse in una Hebridum
insularum narratur.&#8221; &#8220;A desert country in which there are a
great many wild horses, sheep and cattle, as is said to be
the case in one of the Hebrides.&#8221;</p>

<p>That this Van Langren globe was well received by his
contemporaries seems to be witnessed by the special
privilege granted September 9, 1592, to Jacobus Florentius a
Langren by the Estates of Amsterdam to issue the same.<a
name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a
href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> On presenting his
request for the privilege the author states that he was the
inventor of globes of this character, that his globes were
unsurpassed in the matter of correctness by any which had
been previously issued, and that with the aid <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>of his globes certain
Dutch navigators had sailed to Pernambuco in Brazil, to the
island of St. Thomas under the equator, to the Isle de
Principe and to other places. This privilege was renewed to
him and to his sons Arnoldus and Henricus in the year 1596.
In the following year the Estates General granted a
privilege to Jodocus Hondius, who had constructed a globe in
England in the year 1593, of which, however, no example
appears now to be known. The Van Langrens contested this
claim at law, the results of which contest seem not to be
recorded, but we know that Jodocus Hondius enumerated at
this time what he considered to be the particular points in
which his own globes excelled.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> In his report he
enumerated no less than fourteen important geographical
discoveries which were not represented on the globes of his
opponents, the Van Langrens, the majority of which, as
corrections, seem to have been accepted, since they appear
on the later Van Langren globes and not on the earlier, that
is, on the one of 1585.</p>

<p>The Kon. Nederl. Aardrijkskundig Genootschap has recently
come into possession of the finest known example of the Van
Langren globes (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f85">85</a>), as indeed it is one of the
finest extant globes of that period.<a name="FNanchor_373"
id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> The engraved gores, twelve in number,
are pasted on a hollow sphere of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;
and plaster, having a diameter of 52.8 cm. It is furnished
with a graduated copper meridian circle within which it is
adjusted to revolve, a horizon circle of wood on which
appear the names of the winds in Greek, Latin, and Dutch,
the names of the months, the names of the principal feast
days, and the signs of the zodiac, the whole resting on a
base of oak having six supporting columns. As an example of
the engraver&#8217;s art the map which covers the sphere is one of
superior excellence. A manuscript dedication, pasted on its
surface near the &#8220;Mar di India&#8221; and surmounted by a
representation of the Spanish coat of arms, reads, &#8220;Collegio
Ratiociniorum Brabanti regnantibus; Alberto et Isabellae

&#8220;To the College of Computations of Brabant, to Albert and
Isabella, the very great Princes of Belgium, Arnold
Florentius van Langren dedicates with great respect (this
globe) in the year 1612.&#8221; Beneath &#8220;Nova Guinea&#8221; is given the

written over the engraved date 1597.</p>

<p>Among the legends appearing in the southern hemisphere is
one which is but a repetition of that appearing in the
edition of 1585 referring to the source of information
beginning, &#8220;In descriptio hujus ...&#8221; Beneath the artistic
cartouch wherein is placed the last-named legend is one in
which are recorded the names of the author and the engraver,
&#8220;Jacobus Florentius Ultrajectensis Author: Arnoldus
Florentius filius sculptor Amstelredami Ao. Dni,&#8221; the date,
partially erased from the copper plate employed in the
printing, seems to read 1585. Certain regions are adorned
with pictures in which are represented the aborigines, and
the local fauna and flora. Sea monsters constitute a part of
the decorative features of the globe map, and ships sail
hither and thither over the oceans, carrying the flags of
their respective countries. The author has laid down the
&#8220;Streto de Anian&#8221; which separated America from Asia, and
California is a peninsula. The &#8220;Quivira regnum&#8221; is made to
include a part of western North America, and the great
stretch of country to the west of the Mississippi appears to
be the home of wild <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>horses and cattle. The eastern coast
line of America included within the present limits of the
United States is represented with a remarkable approach to
accuracy, a portion of his information for that region being
derived from the report of Thomas Heriot. Following Mercator
there have been placed four large islands around the north
pole, and in the north Atlantic &#8220;Frisland,&#8221; &#8220;S. Brandain,&#8221;
and &#8220;Brasil.&#8221; India, Australia, and other regions of the Far
East have been represented with remarkable faithfulness to
the latest and best records of Dutch navigators, and the
author profited by Dutch records of exploration in his
representation of the Nova Zembla region. There is yet a far
from accurate delineation of the great eastern archipelago.
Java, Celebes, Borneo, and &#8220;Nova Guinea&#8221; have been fairly
well outlined, and about the south pole is that great
austral continent conspicuous on the maps of the period, but
very generally outlined as the fancy of the map maker
directed.</p>

<p>In the library of the University of Ghent is a Van Langren
terrestrial globe undated but apparently completed not long
after 1616, since it directs attention to the Strait of
Lemaire, discovered in that year. It has the authors&#8217;
inscription &#8220;Jacobus Florentius Ultrajectensis Author.
Arnoldus Florentius filius sculptor Amsterdam,&#8221; and bears in
addition the legend &#8220;Arnoldus Florentius a Langren,
Serenissum. Archiducu. Austr. Burgundiae, Brabantiae, Ducum,
Sphaereographus Author. Cum Privileg.&#8221; &#8220;Arnoldus Florentius
a Langren globe maker and author to the most Serene Archduke
of Austria, of Burgundy, Duke of Brabant. With privilege.&#8221;
This globe is described as one well preserved, resembling
very closely that of 1612, particularly in its geographical
details as well as in its mountings.</p>

<p>The Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale of Paris possesses a Van
Langren terrestrial globe, with date illegible, but thought
to be 1625, which appears to be a reissue of the previous
editions, especially of the later ones. A legend including
an address to the reader concludes with a reference to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>author &#8220;Arnoldus Florentio a Langren Reg. Cat. Majis.
cosmografo et pensionario.&#8221; &#8220;Arnoldus Florentius a Langren,
cosmographer and pensioner of His Catholic Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are two globes of Arnoldus, a celestial and a
terrestrial, formerly in the Municipal Archives of Antwerp,
now in the Plantin-Moritus Museum. An inscription on the
celestial globe reads: &#8220;Globus coelestis stellarum fixarum
loca ipsis in coelo ad amussim congrua repraesentans ad
annum 1600 juxta accuratas observationes Tychonis Brahe
denuo ad annum 162&mdash;: diligentiss. restitutus novis

observatis industria Arnoldi Florentii van Langren
Cosmographici, qui olim observationibus: Tyconis interfuit.
Operam sibi filii parenti felicissime contulerunt.&#8221; &#8220;A
celestial globe which represents the position of the fixed
stars, corresponding to the actual position of the stars in
the sky in the year 1600, following the accurate
observations of Tycho Brahe and with great care again
calculated for the year 162&mdash;: also 400 new stars are
added which had not hitherto been recorded. Also there have
been added 300 south polar stars that were observed by
Houtman of Holland. Constructed by Arnold Florent van
Langren, cosmographer who assisted Tycho in his
observations. The sons have aided their father with the
happiest effect.&#8221;</p>

<p>The terrestrial globe, in a much better state of
preservation, contains, in a neat cartouch, an address to
the reader, explaining the merits of the globe map:
&#8220;Quandoquidem quotidiana diversarum nationum, praecipue
tamen Holandorum navigatione omnes mundi plagas
perlustrantium, varii orbis tractus, remotae insulae et

voyages, daily undertaken by various nations, especially the
Dutch, who have sailed along all the coasts of the world,
the various regions of the earth, distant islands, and
innumerable countries hitherto unknown, have every day
become better known (additional facts) and our knowledge of
those already discovered has become much clearer through a
more detailed examination and detailed observation, this
present globe of ours, presents itself to the public as one
much more exact, more free from errors than those previously
issued by us, which were the first ever presented to the
public of these provinces. On it we have recorded the names
of all places, also when and under whose auspices they were
severally discovered. We have taken the greatest care and
pains to make the location of the various regions, islands,
seaports, shoals, and rocks correspond to the true latitude
and longitude, whereby the directions of the winds
(loxodromic lines) ...&#8221; The concluding lines of this address
are illegible, but there seems to be nothing of special
importance lost. The author&#8217;s signature reads &#8220;Auctor
Arnoldo Florentio a Langre Reg. Cat: Ma<sup>tis</sup> Cosmographo et
Pensionario.&#8221; &#8220;Author Arnoldus Florentius a Langren,
cosmographer and pensioner of His Royal Catholic Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>A copy of a Van Langren globe may be found in the Museum of
Z&uuml;tphen, but information concerning it has not been
obtainable other than that it is in a damaged condition, and
is apparently another example of the one referred to above
as of 1612.</p>

<p>Among those interested in geography, in astronomy, and
particularly in the construction of armillary spheres in
this period very special mention should be made of Antonio
Santucci. For some time he served Prince, later Grand Duke,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>Ferdinand de&#8217; Medici as his cosmographer. It was during
this period of service that he restored the famous
terrestrial globe of Egnazio Danti which was a particularly
creditable piece of work. In the year 1582 he constructed a
large armillary sphere composed of wooden rings, very
artistically gilded and painted, representing in particular
the orbits of the planets. This the Prince is said to have
presented to one Battaglioni of Naples; further than this
fact nothing seems to be known of this particular example.
In the year 1606, we are informed, he collected and sent to
the Grand Duke a number of valuable maps relating to Europe,
Asia, Africa, and the West Indies, and to the several
separate countries of Europe. In the year 1619 he published,
through the favor of Duke Ferdinand, a treatise on comets
and the new stars appearing between the years 1577 and 1607.
What is probably the finest of all his spheres belongs to
the Museo di Strumenti Antichi of Florence, which has been
restored and interestingly described by the distinguished
scholar, Ferdinand Meucci.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> As an instrument intended to
represent the entire universe, though constructed for
display rather than for use, it remains one of the finest
constructed in the peninsula during the century.</p>

<p>The largest of its nine concentric circles has a diameter of
220 cm., the smallest a diameter of 70 cm., and at the
common center is a terrestrial globe having a diameter of 60
cm. Each of the nine great circles or spheres has its own
smaller circles representing the equator, the ecliptic, the
colures, and the polar circles, the ninth having also the
tropics and the hour circle. The eighth, representing the
starry heavens, has its ecliptic four times the width of the
corresponding circles of the other spheres. Meucci states,
in his detailed description, that there are no less than
eighty-two armillae or rings, large and small, to which, he
adds, eight larger ones might be added, these being cut in
half and arranged somewhat in the form of a cup, the lower
half supporting the horizon circle, the upper half serving
as a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>support for an adjustable cover of the entire
instrument. This arrangement suggests that it was the
author&#8217;s intention to have these last-named half circles
represent the empyrean or home of the celestial spirits, a
thought supported by the fact that at the common
intersecting point of the upper half of these circles is
placed a disc on which is represented the Deity in the act
of contemplating his creation. The whole instrument is
topped by a cross.</p>

<p>Meucci, in referring to his own work of restoring and
remounting the great sphere, observes that at the poles of
the ecliptic there are two discs on which have been painted
the coat of arms of the Medici family together with the coat
of arms of the Lorena, Christina di Lorena being the wife of
Ferdinand, to whom the work had been dedicated. He further
notes that his researches led him to the discovery that the
instrument originally cost 1052.2 scudi, which, with an
incidental addition of 170 scudi, thought proper to be
included in the reckoning, would make the entire expense of
construction 1222.2 scudi or about 7187 liri, that is, less
than $1400. The amount seems insignificant, remembering that
the work was begun in the year 1588 and was not completed
until the year 1593, claiming therefore five years of the
maker&#8217;s time. The map on the terrestrial globe seems to have
been well drawn, and is remarkable for its representation of
the geography of the interior of Africa, particularly for
the region about the source of the Nile.</p>

<p>In the library of Mr. Henry E. Huntington may be found an
exceedingly fine armillary sphere (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f86">86</a>). It is
neither signed nor dated, but there appears to be good
reason for attributing it to Antonio Santucci, and its date
to about the year 1580. Constructed entirely of wood, with
paper identifying labels pasted on the surface of each of
the numerous circles, it is a well-preserved example of
Italian workmanship. It is furnished with horizon, meridian,
tropical, polar, and ecliptic circles, the first being
graduated on both the outer and the inner edge. This horizon
circle has a diameter <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>of about 50 cm., and a width of
about 7 cm., the width of the other circles being well
proportioned for artistic effect. Within the circles named
are those representing the orbits of &#8220;Luna,&#8221; &#8220;Mercurio,&#8221;
&#8220;Venere,&#8221; &#8220;Sole,&#8221; &#8220;Marte,&#8221; &#8220;Giove,&#8221; &#8220;Saturno,&#8221; with the
earth at the center according to the Ptolemaic system. It
has a single standard support resting on a solid circular
disc about 33 cm. in diameter.</p>

<p>The Mathematisch-Physikal. Salon of Dresden possesses a fine
celestial globe signed and dated &#8220;B. F. 1600.&#8221; It is an
exceedingly elaborate piece (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#f87">87</a>), being made of
gilded bronze and furnished with a mounting of ornamental
design. The sphere, having a diameter of 11.6 cm., exhibits
on its engraved surface in outline the figures of the
several constellations, with the name of each, and in
addition the principal celestial circles including the
meridians. It is furnished, in its mountings, with a
graduated bronze meridian circle to which is attached, near
the north equatorial pole, a clock dial with hour and minute
hands, the dial being marked with the hours from I to XII.
Surmounting the whole is an artistic bronze box, within
which have been placed the works by means of which the clock
is driven and the sphere made to revolve. The broad horizon
circle, which is engraved with the usual concentric circles,
rests upon branched supports, which in turn are attached to
a finely wrought base having four curved legs terminating in
conventionally designed griffin claws.</p>

<p>Though differing very considerably in the details of its
construction, it may be classed with such globes as are
those made by Roll and Reinhold, briefly described above.
Indeed, the suggestion forces itself upon one that to their
workshop or to one who may be referred to as a workman of
their school, we owe this interesting example. Attention has
been previously called to certain early globes which seem
primarily to have been constructed to contain the works of
clocks such as the Jagellonicus. Here as in the case of the
Roll and Reinhold globes, and as in certain other examples,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>we find clockwork attachments designed to regulate the
revolutions of the globe of which they form a part. While
the globe is the more elaborately wrought part of this
particular example, it does not seem improbable that the
clock originally was considered to be the more important
part.</p>

<p>In the year 1520 Peter Apianus published in his edition of
Solinus&#8217; Polyhistor a world map, following therein the
general design of Waldseem&uuml;ller in his world map of the
year 1507. The map of Apianus has long been regarded as one
of the most important of the early printed maps on which the
New World is represented. Until the recent discovery by
Professor Joseph Fischer of Waldseem&uuml;ller&#8217;s long-lost
map, it has frequently been referred to as the first
engraved map on which the name &#8220;America&#8221; appears. The
&#8216;Cosmographia&#8217; of Apianus, first issued in the year 1524,
was frequently reissued thereafter, notably by Gemma
Frisius.</p> </div>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
